<p>- Hello, I'm PBS Wisconsin
special projects journalist</p>
<p>Murv Seymour.</p>
<p>In a series of special reports,
we take an in-depth look</p>
<p>at systemic racism
here in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Its history across the state
is painfully complex</p>
<p>and opens lots
of old and new wounds.</p>
<p>In this first episode of
Wisconsin in Black & White,</p>
<p>we take a look at history
and the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>- Professor Ion Meyn: There are
more Black Americans in prison</p>
<p>than white Americans right now.</p>
<p>That is, and should be,
completely shocking.</p>
<p>It is apartheid.</p>
<p>- Noble Wray: It takes a society</p>
<p>to look at this
in a different way.</p>
<p>- Secretary Kevin Carr:
That's a statistic</p>
<p>that I don't think any of us
should be proud of.</p>
<p>- Justice Jill Karofsky:
Oh, my God,</p>
<p>this is such a big problem.</p>
<p>- Murv: We ask the question,
"How did we get here?"</p>
<p>[door clatters]</p>
<p>[twinkling music]
[typewriter clicking]</p>
<p>- Jackson: Systemic racism means
that within that society,</p>
<p>you have factors
about people's lives</p>
<p>that you can predict
the outcomes of their lives</p>
<p>on the day that they're born,</p>
<p>based on the racial groups
that they belong to.</p>
<p>- Murv: Reggie Jackson
educates people about diversity.</p>
<p>- Racism has been a part
of Wisconsin history</p>
<p>since it began as a state.</p>
<p>I often times joke with people</p>
<p>that I call Wisconsin
"Wississippi"</p>
<p>because we generally think
of racism in the South.</p>
<p>- Dr. Christy Clark-Pujara:
Lincoln opposed
slavery's expansion,</p>
<p>not its existence.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Dr. Christy
Clark-Pujara is an author,</p>
<p>and she teaches
African American history</p>
<p>at the University
of Wisconsin- Madison.</p>
<p>- Systemic racism, much of it,</p>
<p>is an extension of the creation
of race-based slavery.</p>
<p>And race-based slavery
was created through law,</p>
<p>and that was done
in the colonial period.</p>
<p>- Jesus give you
some tough love.</p>
<p>Racism is huge
here in Wisconsin,</p>
<p>and it's worse
than it's ever been.</p>
<p>Milwaukee is kind of special.</p>
<p>This is the Selma of the North.</p>
<p>When I go to other places,</p>
<p>people don't even know
that Milwaukee</p>
<p>have Black folks living here.</p>
<p>Say, "There's Black folks
in Milwaukee?"</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>And they've been oppressed
like crazy. [laughs]</p>
<p>- Not surprisingly, the highest
demographic representation</p>
<p>of African Americans...</p>
<p>- Murv: University of Wisconsin
law professor</p>
<p>Ion Meyn teaches
race and the law,</p>
<p>civil rights,
and wrongful convictions.</p>
<p>- White society
is addicted to racism.</p>
<p>- Seymour: He has a lot to say
about the racial climate</p>
<p>in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>- I don't know
what makes Milwaukee</p>
<p>the most segregated city
in the United States.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>And I don't know what makes
the practices in Milwaukee</p>
<p>generate an overrepresentation
of Black people in prison</p>
<p>so that it's the highest
in the nation.</p>
<p>If you're a Black person,
Black resident in Wisconsin,</p>
<p>you have a 12 times
higher chance</p>
<p>of being incarcerated
than a white Wisconsinite.</p>
<p>- Seymour: History tells us
the over-policing of Blacks</p>
<p>in Wisconsin
and across the country</p>
<p>dates back
to the end of slavery.</p>
<p>- When the 13th Amendment
to the Constitution</p>
<p>was ratified
in December of 1865,</p>
<p>most people never read
what it says.</p>
<p>- It abolishes slavery,
and then there's a semi-colon,</p>
<p>"Except for punishment</p>
<p>for those who have been
found guilty of a felony."</p>
<p>- It creates the ability
for you to be back in slavery</p>
<p>in a different form.</p>
<p>Something like loitering,</p>
<p>which had never been illegal
before, becomes illegal.</p>
<p>- Whistling in public.</p>
<p>Like, I mean,
like that level of nonsense.</p>
<p>Walking along a railroad track,</p>
<p>not being able to produce
employment papers on demand.</p>
<p>You steal a pig,
you go to prison for life.</p>
<p>- Instead of sending you
to prison,</p>
<p>someone who owns a plantation
or a mine</p>
<p>or some business
who wants some free labor,</p>
<p>they'll be able to come in
and grab you</p>
<p>and put you into that system</p>
<p>so that you're
not gonna go to prison.</p>
<p>Now you're gonna go back
and work for free.</p>
<p>- Society says, "Oh, my gosh,</p>
<p>Black people have a propensity
to commit crimes,"</p>
<p>versus what was going on,</p>
<p>which was they were
arresting Black people</p>
<p>for committing no crime, and
then sending them to slavery.</p>
<p>- Seymour: The small town
of Appleton</p>
<p>was once the center of one
of the most racist tactics used</p>
<p>across the country to keep
Blacks out of white communities.</p>
<p>- Meyn: Appleton doesn't really
have any Black people,</p>
<p>and if you asked people
in Appleton,</p>
<p>it's just because Black people
didn't wanna move there.</p>
<p>Black people lived in Appleton
before the 1880s,</p>
<p>and they attempted to join
a growing community</p>
<p>during the '40s and '50s,</p>
<p>but it was a sundown town
through 1970</p>
<p>and enforced by the police.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Sundown towns
were places</p>
<p>that didn't allow Blacks</p>
<p>and other people of color
after dark.</p>
<p>- Jackson: They were
all over Wisconsin.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Nearly 250 in all,
according to a database</p>
<p>created by Washington, D.C.
sociologist James Loewen.</p>
<p>- Dr. Christy Clark-Pujara:
So, Black people
can be there as workers,</p>
<p>they can come to fish
during the day,</p>
<p>but you'd better
be out by night.</p>
<p>- Jackson: Some places
had a horn that would ring</p>
<p>in the evening when it was time
for Black people to get out.</p>
<p>Some places literally had signs
on the side of the roadway</p>
<p>that said, you know,
"After the sun sets,</p>
<p>Black people,
you're not welcome here."</p>
<p>- Seymour: About that time,</p>
<p>the prison population
in Wisconsin</p>
<p>and everywhere else
begins to explode.</p>
<p>[dramatic trumpet music]</p>
<p>- Reporter: Six days of rioting</p>
<p>in a Negro section
of Los Angeles left...</p>
<p>- Meyn: After the Watts riot,</p>
<p>white people blamed Black people
for the problem.</p>
<p>The response was a call
for federal funding</p>
<p>to provide a more
robust policing of these areas.</p>
<p>We started to see
this war on crime.</p>
<p>- Sec. Kevin Carr:
I'm aware that the current
criminal justice system</p>
<p>has a disproportionately large
number of persons of color</p>
<p>involved in it.</p>
<p>It makes me somewhat
sensitive to,</p>
<p>hopefully, being able
to address the needs</p>
<p>of that population in a way
that is fair to everyone.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Former Madison
police chief Noble Wray</p>
<p>sits on the governor's
pardon board.</p>
<p>- The politics back then
was tough on crime,</p>
<p>tough on drugs, say no to drugs.</p>
<p>It was, you know,
a zero-tolerance approach.</p>
<p>- You're not going to hire
all of these police officers</p>
<p>for them to sit around
and do nothing.</p>
<p>- Meyn: It was
billions of dollars.</p>
<p>- Officer 1:
Open the ####ing door,</p>
<p>or I'm gonna break
the ####ing window.</p>
<p>- Officer 2:
Open the door, man.</p>
<p>- Meyn: It was changing the face
of corrections and policing.</p>
<p>- Officer 1: So if
you cooperate...</p>
<p>- All of that money focused
on those communities of color.</p>
<p>- You end up with
a disproportionate population</p>
<p>that are under
the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>- If you live in the quote,
unquote hood and poor areas,</p>
<p>you are policed in a way</p>
<p>that people in affluent areas
are not, right?</p>
<p>And so you are just more likely
to find yourself</p>
<p>in front of a judge.</p>
<p>- White individuals,
their cases get dismissed</p>
<p>at a rate 50% higher
than the Black individuals.</p>
<p>There's a higher rate
of sentencing Black individuals</p>
<p>for the same crime,
at every part of the system.</p>
<p>By the way,
there's a higher rate</p>
<p>of Black individuals
for the same thing</p>
<p>being sent to a higher level
of security prison.</p>
<p>And then there's a higher rate
of white people in prison</p>
<p>getting good time credits
than Black people.</p>
<p>If you look at every part
of the system,</p>
<p>it doesn't matter
where you look.</p>
<p>You're going to find
these drivers of disparity.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Today,
former governor Tommy Thompson</p>
<p>and others admit
building more prisons</p>
<p>was the wrong approach.</p>
<p>Now retired, Thompson
is a passionate advocate</p>
<p>for more educational
opportunities</p>
<p>for those incarcerated.</p>
<p>- The increased crime indicated</p>
<p>that we needed more prisons
at the time,</p>
<p>and which I accommodated.</p>
<p>But every time I did this,</p>
<p>I always tried to balance
on the other side.</p>
<p>I was big on welfare reform.</p>
<p>I was big
on workforce development.</p>
<p>I was big
on expanding education.</p>
<p>- Domineé Meek:
In February of 1992,</p>
<p>I had been expelled...</p>
<p>- Seymour: At age 15,</p>
<p>Domineé Meek received
a life sentence</p>
<p>for taking the life
of Warren Smith, Junior,</p>
<p>an innocent bystander.</p>
<p>Domineé believes he and other
Black and brown teens</p>
<p>receive harsher sentences</p>
<p>compared with whites
the same age,</p>
<p>convicted of the same crime.</p>
<p>- Domineé Meek:
When I was incarcerated,</p>
<p>I only met one person
that was white</p>
<p>that was sentenced as a juvenile
to life in prison.</p>
<p>They took Black boys</p>
<p>and said that
"Y'all are Black men."</p>
<p>And they punished us like men.</p>
<p>They don't do that
to white boys.</p>
<p>Not in the numbers.</p>
<p>They gave them help.</p>
<p>- In Wisconsin,
the number of, kind of,</p>
<p>criminal referrals
is three times higher</p>
<p>for Black kids than white kids.</p>
<p>- You got two or three
generations of Black parents</p>
<p>who have been incarcerated.</p>
<p>The majority of the people
locked up are Black and brown.</p>
<p>So when you got
the majority of us locked up,</p>
<p>you can't be a parent
from prison.</p>
<p>So when that child
looks for that,</p>
<p>only place he goes to get it
is in the streets.</p>
<p>So we need father figures
to step up,</p>
<p>somebody to be,
that I can call</p>
<p>at 2 o'clock in the morning
and say,</p>
<p>"Murv, I'm locked up,
can you come get me?"</p>
<p>Or "Murv, I'm scared,
can you come get me?"</p>
<p>Or "Murv,"
and when I disappoint Murv,</p>
<p>that still
is gonna love me</p>
<p>like Murv would love
his own children.</p>
<p>- Seymour: In 2020,
Domineé walked out</p>
<p>of Oakhill Correctional
Institution after 28 years.</p>
<p>He says he doesn't feel free.</p>
<p>- When I left prison
in September,</p>
<p>one hole was filled,
but one wasn't.</p>
<p>Warren can never come back
and hug his mama,</p>
<p>hug his baby girl.</p>
<p>I live my happiness,
and I live this life,</p>
<p>but I never forget about Warren.</p>
<p>The goal is to prevent
another Domineé</p>
<p>from killing another Warren.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Domineé
is a former student</p>
<p>of Odyssey Beyond Bars,</p>
<p>a college jumpstart program
at Oakhill.</p>
<p>Peter Moreno runs it</p>
<p>on behalf of the
University of Wisconsin,</p>
<p>out of four institutions
in the state.</p>
<p>- We've learned
through experience</p>
<p>that long prison sentences,</p>
<p>while they may be appropriate
for certain crimes,</p>
<p>are not appropriate
for a lot of crimes.</p>
<p>And long prison sentences,</p>
<p>combined with a lack
of programming in the prisons,</p>
<p>can be especially harmful</p>
<p>because we're keeping people
in an environment</p>
<p>where they're unable to learn,</p>
<p>unable to grow,
unable to socialize,</p>
<p>and then we're letting them
go back to their communities,</p>
<p>expecting them to do well.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Moreno encourages
a closer look</p>
<p>at the conditions
of neighborhoods</p>
<p>and fixing problems
leading to people</p>
<p>entering the criminal justice
system.</p>
<p>- We know how to deal
with many of these issues.</p>
<p>- Seymour: With the recidivism
rate of just over 31%,</p>
<p>Wray says there are
four support systems</p>
<p>proven to help close
the sometimes-revolving door</p>
<p>back to prison.</p>
<p>- Do you have a place to live
when you get out,</p>
<p>and is that place solid,
does it reinforce,</p>
<p>does it support you?</p>
<p>Two, do you have employment,
which is big.</p>
<p>Three, do you have the people
around you that support you</p>
<p>and that will help you in terms
of doing the right things,</p>
<p>making the right decisions?</p>
<p>And the fourth one is treatment.</p>
<p>- Wisconsin should be
less worried about</p>
<p>getting a bad rap
and more worried</p>
<p>about improving the lives
of the people in this state</p>
<p>who live
in our communities of color.</p>
<p>- Seymour: In 2016, Supreme
Court Justice Jill Karofsky</p>
<p>took part in a course called</p>
<p>"Justified Anger: Black History
for a New Day."</p>
<p>The program was run by the
Madison organization Nehemiah,</p>
<p>which focuses on strengthening
the African American community</p>
<p>in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Justice Karofsky says
the course</p>
<p>on racial disparities
in the criminal justice system</p>
<p>gave her a new understanding
of how, at times,</p>
<p>the criminal justice system</p>
<p>unfairly impacts
people of color.</p>
<p>- This country was founded
by white men</p>
<p>who were well-intentioned</p>
<p>and who created a system of laws
and the Constitution</p>
<p>that was built
on the idea of freedom.</p>
<p>But back in the late 1700s,</p>
<p>we know that they didn't mean
freedom for all people.</p>
<p>Because of that,
it has been the white majority</p>
<p>who has been in control
of so much of this country.</p>
<p>Business, of government,
of the financial world.</p>
<p>It is gonna need to be
leaders in those areas</p>
<p>that are going to have to help
make the change</p>
<p>that so many of us
wanna see.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Justice Karofsky says</p>
<p>inspiration from attending
"Justified Anger"</p>
<p>led her to bring the Nehemiah
anti-racism trainings</p>
<p>to other judges across the state</p>
<p>in the form of intense,
one-day sessions.</p>
<p>- Do you think that we have</p>
<p>too much emphasis
on race these days?</p>
<p>- No.</p>
<p>Most Supreme Court justices
don't do interviews like this.</p>
<p>The reason I am doing this
interview and I agreed to do it</p>
<p>is because I think, and I
believe, and I know, and I see</p>
<p>that it is a problem
in our state,</p>
<p>and maybe if I stand up
and sit here,</p>
<p>as uncomfortable
as it may be for me,</p>
<p>that that may help
be part of the change.</p>
<p>One of the ways we can do that</p>
<p>is to try to reach out
to our colleagues of color,</p>
<p>to mentor them,
to learn from them</p>
<p>because their experience
is very, very rich</p>
<p>and could be different
than ours.</p>
<p>And then, to help them succeed,
should they wanna run for judge,</p>
<p>or should they wanna ask
for an appointment.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Secretary Carr says
he sees a shift</p>
<p>from simply locking people up
for public safety</p>
<p>to providing more treatment,
more education,</p>
<p>more trauma-based care.</p>
<p>- We have started
to rely more on alternatives</p>
<p>to revocations,
such as short-term sanctions</p>
<p>and community-based programming,
and for instance,</p>
<p>like drug treatment referral
for minor possession cases</p>
<p>as opposed to sending
that person back to prison.</p>
<p>- Each of us needs to figure out
what is it that we can do.</p>
<p>If it's only one thing,
then it's only one thing.</p>
<p>- Alex: We really wanted to have
a brick-and-mortar space,</p>
<p>like, in the heart of the city</p>
<p>where people could
come together.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Short Stack Eatery
in Madison</p>
<p>serves up
a lot more than food.</p>
<p>- Alex: Gosh, as white folks,
we have so much to learn.</p>
<p>[bell dings]</p>
<p>- Seymour: Its owner says
their spot serves as an example</p>
<p>of how to help equalize
what they consider</p>
<p>the uneven intersections
of race and inequality.</p>
<p>- Alex Lindenmeyer: We're
definitely unapologetically</p>
<p>trying to become less and less
racist every day. [laughs]</p>
<p>That's our goal.</p>
<p>We figure if we can unravel
some of our racist tendencies</p>
<p>and indoctrinations,
everybody can.</p>
<p>- Seymour: At her restaurant,</p>
<p>Lindenmeyer's job applications
look different.</p>
<p>There is no box to check
if you have a felony conviction.</p>
<p>- The fact that we don't have
a box on our application,</p>
<p>and we don't do
background checks,</p>
<p>and we don't do drug testing,
and all those things.</p>
<p>- Seymour: For years, they have
also routinely sent its managers</p>
<p>to the Nehemiah's nine-week
"Justified Anger" course.</p>
<p>- We have huge, huge systems
to figure out</p>
<p>how to disassemble
and reassemble,</p>
<p>and so it's gonna be
lifelong work.</p>
<p>- They said 92%
of our community</p>
<p>didn't even know that
there was a mayoral election.</p>
<p>- Alex: Black folks
can't do it alone.</p>
<p>They can't do it without us.</p>
<p>We're the one
causing the violence.</p>
<p>- Stop running people over here
out in these streets.</p>
<p>Stop shooting folks, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, they need to fix it.</p>
<p>We ain't gonna fix that, man.</p>
<p>We're the hated ones.</p>
<p>[gentle music]</p>
<p>- We continue
our reporting on race</p>
<p>and the criminal justice
system in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>We are here at Short Stack
Eatery in Madison,</p>
<p>and we are joined by the owner
of Short Stack Eatery,</p>
<p>Alex Lindenmeyer,
and we've also got Dr. Alex Gee</p>
<p>of Nehemiah's
"Justified Anger" project,</p>
<p>and Carl Fields,
who is with EXPO,</p>
<p>which stands for EX-
incarcerated People Organizing,</p>
<p>and he's also representing
Wisdom, a faith-based group</p>
<p>that operates out of the state
of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Alex, I wanna start with you.</p>
<p>You mentioned,
during our pre-interview,</p>
<p>that you felt like
Wisconsin business owners</p>
<p>could do more to help
impact the disparity</p>
<p>that we see in the
criminal justice system.</p>
<p>What do you think
they can learn</p>
<p>from some of the things
that you're doing here?</p>
<p>And I'd love to hear what you
guys have to say about it, too.</p>
<p>- People that are
justice-involved</p>
<p>have so many things
that they're dealing with.</p>
<p>So employers need to internally</p>
<p>start having
the conversation about</p>
<p>what the criminal justice system
even looks like now.</p>
<p>If you're not justice-involved,</p>
<p>or you don't have
a family member,</p>
<p>or you don't have an employee
that's justice-involved,</p>
<p>it's designed on purpose
for you to not care,</p>
<p>for you to not know.</p>
<p>And so employers really need
to get educated internally</p>
<p>about what's going on</p>
<p>and what these barriers are
that people are up against,</p>
<p>and then figure out how
they can set up support systems</p>
<p>within their culture
and within their organization</p>
<p>to make sure people
get what they need.</p>
<p>- Yeah, we know that
you purposefully hire folks</p>
<p>that do have barriers.</p>
<p>Carl, how does that help folks
that are transitioning?</p>
<p>- To know that
there are companies</p>
<p>that are sticking
to what society intended</p>
<p>for criminal justice
to be is huge,</p>
<p>and that is tangible
to say, "Yeah,</p>
<p>"oh, you paid your dues,
come on.</p>
<p>"We, not only will we like
to work with you,</p>
<p>"but we'd be honored to</p>
<p>"because you got something
you wanna show,</p>
<p>you got something
you wanna prove."</p>
<p>And we're also
creating opportunities</p>
<p>that that's a real job,
you know, opportunity</p>
<p>to give to somebody who is
really in need of that.</p>
<p>- And Doctor, your organization
runs a re-entry program?</p>
<p>- Dr. Alex Gee:
It does; it does.</p>
<p>- And how do you see businesses
being able to impact things?</p>
<p>- If we want to attract large
businesses to this community,</p>
<p>where again,
there's low unemployment,</p>
<p>we have to help people
who are in this community,</p>
<p>wanting to work, willing
to work, to become employed.</p>
<p>So one of the things that we do
through our re-entry program</p>
<p>is we help to find jobs
for men and women,</p>
<p>particularly men,
with our programming,</p>
<p>to find jobs, you know.</p>
<p>My vice president for re-entry,</p>
<p>a gentleman named
Anthony Cooper,</p>
<p>has placed over 1,000 men over
the past eight or nine years.</p>
<p>That's significant because
when you come out of prison,</p>
<p>and you have stable employment,
you can have stable housing,</p>
<p>which means you can live
a stable life in the community,</p>
<p>and it drastically reduces
the temptation to recidivize.</p>
<p>So we have a responsibility
to our own state's economy</p>
<p>and to the well-being
of good people.</p>
<p>We need them in order
for our economy to be stronger</p>
<p>in this community.</p>
<p>- I would love to hear
what you folks think</p>
<p>are some of the
biggest challenges</p>
<p>facing our criminal justice
system.</p>
<p>- You know, when we talk about,
you know,</p>
<p>alternatives to whether it be
a deferment program</p>
<p>through the court on pretrial,</p>
<p>or during incarceration,
or post-incarceration,</p>
<p>those programs,
those options that come up</p>
<p>are always met
with a zero margin of error.</p>
<p>And that is so problematic to me</p>
<p>because the current system
and what it produces</p>
<p>is not held to any sort
of standard on that level,</p>
<p>but in fact, does have
a low effectiveness rate.</p>
<p>But we can't seem to take some
chances to try something else</p>
<p>because it's not politically
advantageous always.</p>
<p>It's not classy; it's not sexy.</p>
<p>- What role do you think
our federal government</p>
<p>and our state government,
what role do you think they play</p>
<p>in affecting the
criminal justice system</p>
<p>here in the state?</p>
<p>- I think that these
governmental agencies</p>
<p>need to really own up</p>
<p>to the fact that
this criminal system</p>
<p>is really producing what
it was designed to produce,</p>
<p>this ugly, ugly cycle.</p>
<p>It needs to be called out
and dismantled</p>
<p>so we can build something
that's equitable</p>
<p>and that really
does rehabilitate.</p>
<p>- The history
of how systems were built</p>
<p>and what they were built for,</p>
<p>that plays out, continues
to play out even to this day,</p>
<p>a hundred-plus years later,</p>
<p>and that is a weight on any
person who enters the system.</p>
<p>As an ex-knucklehead myself,
turned professional,</p>
<p>I messed up in life,
I made some poor choices,</p>
<p>but no one anywhere
in the criminal justice system</p>
<p>told me that felonies
were gonna be forever.</p>
<p>I've seen that the barriers
just continue,</p>
<p>seen that no matter what I do</p>
<p>or how much of a great effort
I put forward,</p>
<p>society's still allowed to
socially acceptably mistreat me.</p>
<p>- You could buy someone a house
and send them to college</p>
<p>for what it costs, you know,</p>
<p>at least put a down payment
on a house,</p>
<p>for what it costs
to incarcerate.</p>
<p>So what are we
really trying to do?</p>
<p>We have the money;
why are we locking people up</p>
<p>when we could use resources
or redirect them</p>
<p>to really help people
out of a hole?</p>
<p>- I learned in my reporting the
term 'crimeless revocations.'</p>
<p>I'd love to get you to,
you know,</p>
<p>let our viewers know
what it exactly means</p>
<p>and how it leads and feeds
the pipeline to prison.</p>
<p>- The working definition
of a crimeless revocation</p>
<p>is placing a person into prison</p>
<p>or placing a person
back into incarceration</p>
<p>for not having
committed a new crime,</p>
<p>but for a technical violation
or rules violation of some kind.</p>
<p>- The way that plays out
specifically is perhaps</p>
<p>you bought a car and didn't
get it cleared with your agent.</p>
<p>- Alex: Yeah,
you used a computer.</p>
<p>- You used a computer.</p>
<p>You got married
and didn't ask for permission.</p>
<p>I know that
those are some extreme things,</p>
<p>but I know folks who have
feared for their lives</p>
<p>or their freedom for doing
things just like that.</p>
<p>But just think about this,</p>
<p>the crazy numbers,
to Alex's point,</p>
<p>of people in prison
are folks who have returned</p>
<p>on technicalities.</p>
<p>- We look at states like Oregon,</p>
<p>we look at states
like Washington,</p>
<p>that are putting huge dollars
into programs</p>
<p>of figuring out how to get
parents things they need</p>
<p>while they're locked up,</p>
<p>figuring out how
to get families reunited</p>
<p>while folks are locked up,</p>
<p>figuring how to get families
that have somebody locked up</p>
<p>the resources they need.</p>
<p>And our state has a lot
of catching up to do, for sure.</p>
<p>- Minnesota has a comparable
demographic to Wisconsin,</p>
<p>but they don't incarcerate
nearly as much as we do.</p>
<p>It really is big business.</p>
<p>That's not just cliché;
it's really big business.</p>
<p>- Another learning process
I went through in this reporting</p>
<p>is I learned about language,
and I learned that</p>
<p>I'm guilty of saying some things
that, you know,</p>
<p>aren't humanizing people.</p>
<p>How important is
the language of incarceration?</p>
<p>- When we're talking about
felons or convicts or inmates,</p>
<p>you know, last I checked,
I was a person,</p>
<p>and I continue to be that.</p>
<p>And so person-first language</p>
<p>is something
that we've been driving on</p>
<p>in this work that we do
for quite some time.</p>
<p>- It's the language that
helps us to reinforce barriers.</p>
<p>"This person can't be trusted,</p>
<p>"I don't want you
around my family,</p>
<p>you can't come to my church,
you can't work at my job,"</p>
<p>so it begins
with even the language.</p>
<p>And again, what it conjures
in our minds</p>
<p>about what this person
is capable of,</p>
<p>but when you use
those terminologies,</p>
<p>you don't really think that
they're really ex or former.</p>
<p>It's just you did some time,</p>
<p>but you're still
in that same place,</p>
<p>and that's why
we keep that same title.</p>
<p>We just put ex in front of it.</p>
<p>- I have employees that go
to UW who are 19 and white,</p>
<p>and I have employees
who are 45 on paper,</p>
<p>and we have some disparities,
some differences,</p>
<p>and if we actually
wanna figure out</p>
<p>how to make this a safe place
for everybody to work,</p>
<p>it's a lot of internal
conversation about things like,</p>
<p>"Hey, you can't say convict,</p>
<p>you can't say felon,
here's why."</p>
<p>We gotta figure out
how we got here.</p>
<p>I can preach at you
all this stuff</p>
<p>about the lingo
and the language,</p>
<p>and why it's ineffective
or what have you,</p>
<p>but until people
have a basis</p>
<p>or an understanding
of how we ended up here,</p>
<p>it's a moot point.</p>
<p>- And Dr. Gee,
how do we get all Wisconsinites</p>
<p>to get vested on this?</p>
<p>- I don't even know
if that's my expectation,</p>
<p>but if I can have an impact
on employers</p>
<p>and their new employees,</p>
<p>or individuals who want
to make a difference.</p>
<p>When you invest in people
who wanna make a difference,</p>
<p>you trust
in a ripple effect.</p>
<p>But I've learned
that if I want</p>
<p>to live a healthier
and longer life,</p>
<p>I can't keep beating my head
against the wall</p>
<p>for people who wanna
argue these points.</p>
<p>I need to take the time
to invest in people</p>
<p>who wanna be allies,
who wanna speak out,</p>
<p>and who want to make sure
that everyone</p>
<p>has judicial justice
in their lives.</p>
<p>And so I try to invest
in the people</p>
<p>who want to be
a part of the change</p>
<p>and hope that,
at some point,</p>
<p>we will have an impact
on Wisconsin,</p>
<p>but I don't go after
the whole state.</p>
<p>I just try to really
work with the people</p>
<p>who want to get it.</p>
<p>- We're gonna have
to leave it there.</p>
<p>Thank you all for being here;
Dr. Gee.</p>
<p>- My pleasure.</p>
<p>- Mr. Fields.
- Sir.</p>
<p>- Alex Lindenmeyer,</p>
<p>on behalf of PBS Wisconsin
and our crew,</p>
<p>we appreciate you
for providing a space for us</p>
<p>to have this
important conversation.</p>
<p>- My pleasure.</p>
<p>- And we thank you folks
for joining us, too.</p>

<p>In this episode
ofWisconsin in Black & White,</p>
<p>we took a look
at the history</p>
<p>of race and education
in this state.</p>
<p>Educators and students weigh in
on longtime challenges</p>
<p>Black and brown students face
in the classrooms</p>
<p>throughout Wisconsin,</p>
<p>and we hear about
the work being done</p>
<p>to increase opportunity</p>
<p>and put all students
on equal footing.</p>
<p>[children laughing]</p>
<p>[teacher sounds out letter 'D']
- Children: Oh.</p>
<p>- Look at how Black students are
doing.</p>
<p>It is... terrible.</p>
<p>[gentle, somber music]</p>
<p>- Whatever efforts there have
been by the federal government</p>
<p>to create integrated schools
have not worked.</p>
<p>- Education is the conduit
to freedom.</p>
<p>- We have a lot more work
to do.</p>
<p>- Murv Seymour: Wisconsin.</p>
<p>- We're a microcosm
of the nation.</p>
<p>- We want to create change.</p>
<p>- Seymour: A conversation
about race and education</p>
<p>in this state.</p>
<p>- It is a complex one.</p>
<p>We've never given full
education access to everyone.</p>
<p>- Seymour:
Author and retired University of
Wisconsin Education Professor,</p>
<p>Dr. Gloria Ladson-Billings,
travels the world</p>
<p>learning, teaching, and
training people about education.</p>
<p>- It's Thomas Jefferson
who says,</p>
<p>"Listen, we are not gonna be
able to maintain a democracy</p>
<p>unless the common folks
are educated."</p>
<p>- It goes all the way
to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</p>
<p>- Seymour:
Dr. Christy Clark-Pujara</p>
<p>is a UW-Madison
history professor,</p>
<p>and also works with the
Madison Organization, Nehemiah.</p>
<p>She's an instructor
in its Justified Anger</p>
<p>"Black History
for a New Day" course.</p>
<p>Nehemiah focuses
on strengthening</p>
<p>the African American community
in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The nine-week course
teaches people</p>
<p>about race, history,
and justice.</p>
<p>She and Ladson-Billings help
explain why the playing field</p>
<p>of education began to take shape</p>
<p>out of balance
across the country,</p>
<p>including here in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>- Dr. Christy Clark-Pujara:
The laws against
teaching enslaved people to read</p>
<p>actually come into play</p>
<p>after the founding
of the nation,</p>
<p>in response to
enslaved people</p>
<p>doing things
like forging fake passes.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Written by
their owners,</p>
<p>passes were required for
slaves to leave the plantation</p>
<p>for extra work or errands.</p>
<p>- When we're talking
about access to education,</p>
<p>post-slavery, you just have
cities, states,</p>
<p>and counties</p>
<p>not investing
in the education</p>
<p>of Black people,
who are taxpayers.</p>
<p>They would have
inferior school buildings,</p>
<p>inferior materials, inferior
books, or notebooks, right?</p>
<p>The teachers
were paid less.</p>
<p>And so, it was
an active disinvestment.</p>
<p>My father was
functionally illiterate.</p>
<p>His family was poor,</p>
<p>and he was sharecropping cotton
most of his life,</p>
<p>and his labor was essential
to his family's survival,</p>
<p>and the school that
he could attend was underfunded.</p>
<p>- Seymour: During the
civil rights era,</p>
<p>Milwaukee was
the epicenter of protests,</p>
<p>demanding compliance</p>
<p>to end continued segregation
in schools.</p>
<p>- We tend to think about
the Civil Rights Movement,</p>
<p>like the institution of slavery,</p>
<p>as something that is uniquely
Southern, and it was not.</p>
<p>- Seymour:
While the US Supreme Court's</p>
<p>Brown versus
the Board of Educationruling</p>
<p>in the late 1950s</p>
<p>ordered all US schools
to desegregate,</p>
<p>Milwaukee and other parts
of the state,</p>
<p>like much of the nation,
didn't do so for decades.</p>
<p>- The schools in Milwaukee
are not in line</p>
<p>withBrown versus the Board
of Educationuntil 1979.</p>
<p>- Reggie Jackson:
The city of Milwaukee's
public school system decided,</p>
<p>"Well, we're gonna
build new schools,</p>
<p>but we're gonna build them
on the south side,</p>
<p>which is primarily
the white part of town, right?"</p>
<p>- The schools that Black people
have access to</p>
<p>were severely underfunded.</p>
<p>- Ion Meyn: What you saw
in Black communities</p>
<p>was a continual kind of
decline in the tax base,</p>
<p>and the ability to
support public education</p>
<p>in those communities.</p>
<p>- Seymour: A declining
tax base</p>
<p>due to declining property
values in housing like this</p>
<p>in Milwaukee.</p>
<p>- Housing policy
is education policy.</p>
<p>You go to the schools
in your neighborhood,</p>
<p>and we tend to fund schools</p>
<p>through property taxes.</p>
<p>Better than 60%
of Black and brown kids</p>
<p>still go
to segregated schools.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Schools in
the Milwaukee metro area</p>
<p>are more segregated
for Black and white students</p>
<p>than any other metro area
of the country.</p>
<p>That's comparing
Milwaukee schools</p>
<p>to those
in the surrounding counties</p>
<p>of Ozaukee, Washington,
and Waukesha.</p>
<p>- Whatever efforts there have
been by the federal government</p>
<p>to create integrated
schools have not worked.</p>
<p>- There are many white children</p>
<p>who go to all-white districts,</p>
<p>and nobody says, "Oh, this is
a segregated district."</p>
<p>They say, "This is
a good district."</p>
<p>If you look at performance,</p>
<p>Black and brown kids</p>
<p>continue to lag.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Those students test
below white students in math,</p>
<p>in the early grades,</p>
<p>and it's not just math.</p>
<p>- It speeds
over a hundred miles an hour.</p>
<p>- Seymour: If there's
one indicator</p>
<p>of how students will perform...</p>
<p>- Woman: Reading proficiency
is important</p>
<p>across the races.</p>
<p>- Seymour: ...It's their ability
to read by 3rd grade,</p>
<p>and state assessments show
that just one year later</p>
<p>in the 4th grade,</p>
<p>reading scores for Black and
Hispanic students also lag.</p>
<p>- The most revolutionary
thing we could do</p>
<p>is teach these kids
how to read.</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>[leaf blower humming]</p>
<p>- Seymour: But educators
across Wisconsin are working</p>
<p>to reverse these trends.</p>
<p>At One City grade
school in Madison,</p>
<p>the focus on reading is key.</p>
<p>- Yeah! It kind
of continues on.</p>
<p>- Seymour: 3rd grade teacher,
Kirsty Blattner</p>
<p>teaches reading skills
at this public charter</p>
<p>where more than
80% of the students</p>
<p>are Black, Hispanic,
or multiracial.</p>
<p>Blattner is passionate
about making sure</p>
<p>her students embrace reading.</p>
<p>- Kirsty Blattner: I have a deep
passion for helping scholars</p>
<p>that are struggling
academically.</p>
<p>If you have a scholar</p>
<p>that doesn't feel confident
and comfortable with reading,</p>
<p>then they'll find other ways</p>
<p>to sort of mask that.</p>
<p>Because no one wants to be seen
as not knowing.</p>
<p>Instead of, "I can't do this,
I can't do this yet."</p>
<p>Instead of,
"I'm not good at this."</p>
<p>"What are you good at?</p>
<p>Would you like
to be good at this?"</p>
<p>- Sara Shaw: America has trouble
talking about race, period.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Sara Shaw
researches education</p>
<p>for a nonprofit think
tank out of Milwaukee,</p>
<p>called the Wisconsin
Policy Forum.</p>
<p>- There's a trope
in literacy circles that</p>
<p>before 3rd grade, students are
learning how to read.</p>
<p>And after 3rd grade,</p>
<p>students are
reading to be able to learn.</p>
<p>Think of how many
of your daily activities</p>
<p>become more difficult.</p>
<p>Everything from reading
street signs, to menus,</p>
<p>to engaging in the legal system,</p>
<p>or going to the doctor's office.</p>
<p>- Education is the
conduit to freedom.</p>
<p>- Seymour: From grade school
achievement to high school</p>
<p>where one superintendent
can boast the benefits</p>
<p>of a diverse student body.</p>
<p>- Tremayne Clardy:
We're approximately
35% students of color here</p>
<p>in the Verona Area
School District.</p>
<p>We celebrate diversity here</p>
<p>in the Verona Area
School District,</p>
<p>and we understand
that a diverse clientele</p>
<p>in the students
that we serve</p>
<p>allows us to be
a better district.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Inside
the district's signature</p>
<p>$150 million high school,
Verona Area
school superintendent</p>
<p>Dr. Tremayne Clardy
is straightforward</p>
<p>about his commitment
and obligation</p>
<p>to create equity for
all students in his district,</p>
<p>especially those
that are Black and brown.</p>
<p>- It is our responsibility
to move barriers</p>
<p>but never, never
lowering expectations.</p>
<p>- Seymour: While recent
statewide data</p>
<p>shows a gap
in the graduation rates</p>
<p>of Black and brown students
compared to white students,</p>
<p>Dr. Clardy and other educators</p>
<p>believe the difference in
achievement</p>
<p>has less to do with performance,</p>
<p>and more to do
with something else.</p>
<p>- It's opportunity.</p>
<p>It's definitely not skill.</p>
<p>It's not intellect.</p>
<p>There's not any other
internal barrier</p>
<p>on behalf of
our Black and brown students.</p>
<p>It is purely about access.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Opportunity and
access are why this school</p>
<p>has windows in place of walls,
and wide-open common spaces.</p>
<p>- We are modeling, you know,
other students seeing</p>
<p>that collaborative process.</p>
<p>We set up our
furniture that way.</p>
<p>We set up the classroom
structure that day,</p>
<p>because you know the power
of peer-to-peer interaction,</p>
<p>and what that means
to strengthening education.</p>
<p>- Carri: What is that thing
that's in you?</p>
<p>- Seymour: Meet guidance
counselor Carri Hale.</p>
<p>- There's no typical day</p>
<p>in the world
of a high school counselor.</p>
<p>- Seymour: In the spirit
of strengthening education,</p>
<p>in 2018, the district sent her,
and every other teacher</p>
<p>to the Nehemiah Justified Anger</p>
<p>"Black History
for a New Day" course.</p>
<p>- We really had to get
to the root and heart</p>
<p>of the history of the systems
that have caused</p>
<p>barriers that
we're trying to dismantle.</p>
<p>- Seymour: For Carri Hale...</p>
<p>- It just fed me.</p>
<p>- Seymour: ...the course
has been life changing.</p>
<p>- It's just grown in me
over the years,</p>
<p>and I realized at that time,
there was so much I didn't know.</p>
<p>It benefits me as an educator
so that when I'm working</p>
<p>with a student
who doesn't look like me</p>
<p>or their family
speaks another language,</p>
<p>whatever it might be,</p>
<p>that I can
respect them and value them,</p>
<p>and see them, and honor them
for who they are</p>
<p>in this space we're in.</p>
<p>- Gerald Montgomery:
Well, I definitely struggled</p>
<p>trying to figure out who I was,
just like everybody else.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Senior Gerald
Montgomery says attending</p>
<p>this diverse high school</p>
<p>has made him more
culturally aware than ever.</p>
<p>- When I came here, it was
kind of like a cultural shock,</p>
<p>seeing not too many faces
looking like me.</p>
<p>- Seymour: It's one of
the reasons Gerald got involved</p>
<p>with the school's Black
student union group...</p>
<p>- It's just more of, like,
celebrating Black culture.</p>
<p>- Seymour: ...which anyone
can join.</p>
<p>- The first BSU year, it was,
like, small, like, 10 people,</p>
<p>when I was a freshman,
and now it's like 80.</p>
<p>And just seeing like that
group of Black folks around me,</p>
<p>I feel like that really helps
keeping, like, that balance</p>
<p>of me going through school
and everyday life.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Gerald says
he plans to go to college.</p>
<p>If he goes to a University
of Wisconsin school,</p>
<p>he'll be one of
a few Black students doing so.</p>
<p>Enrollment numbers
show that in 1975,</p>
<p>just 2.5% of students
were Black.</p>
<p>Nearly 50 years later,
their numbers in 2022</p>
<p>still make up just
2.9% of enrollment law.</p>
<p>While Professor Ion Meyn
believes the numbers</p>
<p>should mirror the demographics</p>
<p>of the nation's Black population
of about 14%.</p>
<p>- If that gets to 3%,
is that progress?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We're not close to progress.</p>
<p>We're not close to even
reckoning with our problem.</p>
<p>- Seymour: The UW System lists
diversity as a core value,</p>
<p>and its five-year plan calls</p>
<p>for boosting African American
enrollment to 15% by 2028.</p>
<p>- Dr. Equan Burrows:
College is a aspiration</p>
<p>that is not afforded to all.</p>
<p>It's our honor to serve</p>
<p>and be one of the only
majority-minority institutions</p>
<p>in the state of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Dr. Equan Burrows
is the dean of students</p>
<p>at Milwaukee Area
Technical College,</p>
<p>where more than half
the full-time student population</p>
<p>are minorities.</p>
<p>- It's important that we
level that playing field.</p>
<p>Look forward to
being the mentors.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Dr. Burrows
runs a mentoring program</p>
<p>with about
a hundred Black male students</p>
<p>called
the Men of Color Initiative.</p>
<p>- The goals are
to educate and empower students.</p>
<p>- Seymour: The program
hopes to give students</p>
<p>like Jeremiah Crawford a
better chance to finish college</p>
<p>and keep pace
with other students</p>
<p>who eventually
gain their bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>- Just kind of depends on...</p>
<p>- Jeremiah: I've always wanted
to go to college.</p>
<p>My home life was a shambles.</p>
<p>It was rough
having a father on drugs.</p>
<p>- Seymour: If that
wasn't enough.</p>
<p>- Jeremiah Crawford: High school
was a point where I started</p>
<p>to retreat into myself.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Jeremiah
has something else</p>
<p>that makes learning and life
more difficult.</p>
<p>- Jeremiah: My sickle cell
stood in the way.</p>
<p>- Seymour: He copes
with the blood disorder</p>
<p>sickle cell anemia.</p>
<p>- The last thing that you
wanna do is pick up a book,</p>
<p>and my illness
would just take over.</p>
<p>The Men of Color give us
an opportunity to meet,</p>
<p>and share our emotions
and our feelings,</p>
<p>and struggles we're having.</p>
<p>- Seymour: When it comes to
reading...</p>
<p>- It's a skill that
a lot of people are missing</p>
<p>in this day and age.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Jeremiah
knows its importance.</p>
<p>Every day he says he does...</p>
<p>- About an hour to two hours
of reading.</p>
<p>I would set an alarm
for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Read, stop reading,
take a break.</p>
<p>- Seymour:
He agrees with experts
like Dr. Ladson-Billings</p>
<p>who say, reading about
things you like</p>
<p>organically leads
to more reading.</p>
<p>- If you like self-help books,
you should look for that.</p>
<p>If you want to learn
how to work on a car,</p>
<p>you should read
those type of books.</p>
<p>- I think that's really good;
I liked it.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Hitting the books
is often new</p>
<p>for a population
that schools can leave behind.</p>
<p>People whose incarceration
cut learning short.</p>
<p>An innovative program
hopes to change that.</p>
<p>- There are many,
many justifications</p>
<p>for higher education in prison.</p>
<p>- You opened up a really
important conversation.</p>
<p>- Seymour: This college
classroom is inside a prison.</p>
<p>Odyssey Beyond Bars
conducts this college-level</p>
<p>English composition course
at Racine Correctional</p>
<p>and three other prisons
across the state,</p>
<p>on behalf
of the University of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>- Peter: It transforms
how they look at their lives.</p>
<p>Virtually all of our students
have reported to us</p>
<p>at the end of the class</p>
<p>that the
experience in Odyssey</p>
<p>has made them want to
take more college classes.</p>
<p>There are people in prison</p>
<p>who look around and think,</p>
<p>"I don't ever want
to be back here again,</p>
<p>"and I want to do something
about my life</p>
<p>that ensures that I don't."</p>
<p>- I gave the, quote
commencement speech</p>
<p>at Oakwood Correctional Center.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Each time,
Dr. Ladson-Billing says,</p>
<p>she'd ask one question.</p>
<p>- "Raise your hand
if you were ever suspended?"</p>
<p>I've never had less than
100% of the hands go up.</p>
<p>[gentle poignant music]</p>
<p>- Seymour: Suspensions
and expulsions from high school</p>
<p>can lead to what
has been called,</p>
<p>"the school-to-prison pipeline,"</p>
<p>and at the very least,
disrupt graduation,</p>
<p>and college attainment.</p>
<p>- Now the prisons
are having to go back and say,</p>
<p>"Listen, let's make sure
you get the education</p>
<p>you should have gotten."</p>
<p>- Seymour: If fixing
the opportunity gap</p>
<p>for Black and brown students
is a puzzle,</p>
<p>another important piece of it</p>
<p>is the shortage
of minority teachers.</p>
<p>- They talked about
how my dad would move out,</p>
<p>and how me and my sister...</p>
<p>- Our students want and deserve
to see someone</p>
<p>that looks like them.</p>
<p>- Seymour: For his part,
Superintendent Clardy is proud</p>
<p>of his efforts in his district
to diversify its staff</p>
<p>with people like Kabby Hong,
Teacher of the Year.</p>
<p>- And then, if you look
at this paragraph.</p>
<p>For so many kids of color,</p>
<p>they've never had</p>
<p>a teacher of color.</p>
<p>A lot of the university programs
are not diverse.</p>
<p>So if your feeder pool
of teacher applicants</p>
<p>is not diverse,</p>
<p>then, of course,
you're not gonna have</p>
<p>a diverse
teaching workforce.</p>
<p>- Seymour: In 2020, researchers
at the Wisconsin Policy Forum</p>
<p>took an extensive look
into the racial diversity</p>
<p>of Wisconsin teachers, and
the student-to-teacher pipeline.</p>
<p>The takeaway...
- I want you to...</p>
<p>- Sara: [exhaling]
We have a lot more work to do.</p>
<p>- Seymour: Shaw says, ideally...</p>
<p>- That the diversity of the
student body would be reflected</p>
<p>in the diversity of
the teacher population.</p>
<p>- Seymour: While almost one
third of students in Wisconsin</p>
<p>are students of color, only
about 6% of their teachers are,</p>
<p>and many don't stay.</p>
<p>- Teachers of color who come
into the workforce are leaving</p>
<p>at a faster rate
than our white teachers.</p>
<p>- Okay?</p>
<p>- Seymour: Many educators
say a diverse teaching staff</p>
<p>positively impacts all students
in a lot of different ways.</p>
<p>- We see positive impacts
across everything</p>
<p>from student motivation</p>
<p>to strong student-teacher
relationships,</p>
<p>to absenteeism, graduation rates
and going on to college.</p>
<p>- When you look
at the educational inequities,</p>
<p>I think it is
just intrinsically tied</p>
<p>to the inequities
that are in society,</p>
<p>but it's gonna take
policy changes--</p>
<p>not just talk.</p>
<p>- For his part,
Verona Superintendent Clardy</p>
<p>is moving beyond talking
and taking action.</p>
<p>- I'm not a worrier;
I'm a doer.</p>
<p>And so we're about
doing the work.</p>
<p>- We continue our reporting</p>
<p>on race and education</p>
<p>in the state of Wisconsin
here from the campus</p>
<p>of the University of Wisconsin
in Madison.</p>
<p>Here to continue
the conversation,</p>
<p>we're joined by Dr. Alex Gee</p>
<p>from the Nehemiah Center
for Urban Leadership
and Development.</p>
<p>Mr. Kaleem Caire, Superintendent
of One City Schools</p>
<p>here in Madison,</p>
<p>and Dr. Courtney Bell,
who is the director</p>
<p>of the Wisconsin Center
for Educational Research.</p>
<p>As I've traveled and talked
to folks across the state</p>
<p>about this issue,</p>
<p>I get the sense
that it's a very touchy subject.</p>
<p>Is there something to that?</p>
<p>- Race is a touchy subject
in the United States.</p>
<p>I think, when we think
about systemic racism,</p>
<p>which exists in education,</p>
<p>we think about these sort
of interlocking layers</p>
<p>of systems and policies, right?</p>
<p>So, you only need
to think about</p>
<p>how do we draw
the district boundary,</p>
<p>and the way that interacts
with the neighborhoods,</p>
<p>the neighborhood
attendance zone,</p>
<p>the teachers
the school can attract,</p>
<p>the outcomes that then wind up
in that neighborhood,</p>
<p>that those
are interlocking systems.</p>
<p>So, it is contentious, I think
partly because people do care,</p>
<p>but the persistent inequalities
are hard to look at</p>
<p>in this state,
in particular.</p>
<p>- Dr. Gee, why are people
afraid to talk about this?</p>
<p>- Because I think
it's difficult</p>
<p>to face up to the culpability.</p>
<p>We like to quote statistics,
but we don't really want</p>
<p>to look at our ownership
in the problem</p>
<p>or why we've allowed
it to persist.</p>
<p>In educational services systems,</p>
<p>we want to fight
against racism,</p>
<p>but when we don't
properly address it,</p>
<p>the educational systems
themselves</p>
<p>become breeding grounds
for racism.</p>
<p>And I think we just like
to pass the buck</p>
<p>to someone else without
taking full responsibility.</p>
<p>- I think they're both
absolutely spot on,</p>
<p>but I also think that
we have divorced ourselves</p>
<p>from the problem.</p>
<p>That it is not only something
that I'm embarrassed</p>
<p>or don't want to be culpable in,</p>
<p>but it's been persistent
for so long,</p>
<p>and if I know about it,
I'm tired of hearing of it,</p>
<p>and so, it brings me down.</p>
<p>I've heard people say that,
like,</p>
<p>"I can't focus on the problem
'cause it just brings me down.</p>
<p>"'Cause it's like
we've not solved it,</p>
<p>it's not gonna be solved."</p>
<p>And so, I think
there's a lot of hopelessness.</p>
<p>I also think that we also
live in a state that,</p>
<p>by and large, has been
privileged for a very long time,</p>
<p>particularly in the area
where we are in Madison.</p>
<p>And so, when you're privileged,
and things are going okay,</p>
<p>and you don't have to
focus on the issue,</p>
<p>you act like it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>- But this lack of success
that we're seeing,</p>
<p>is it more to blame
on the teachers,</p>
<p>or is it more to blame
on students?</p>
<p>- I think there's enough blame
to go around, actually.</p>
<p>But I think, if we ignore
the systemic issues,</p>
<p>and only point fingers to the
parents, the students, teachers,</p>
<p>not look
at the larger issue,</p>
<p>I think we continue just
to kick the can down the road.</p>
<p>And so, I think we have to
look at really how we got here.</p>
<p>I think what makes it
even more difficult is</p>
<p>that education has been deemed
the great equalizer.</p>
<p>Education is what brings you
into the mainstream,</p>
<p>and it keeps you from being
discriminated against.</p>
<p>It keeps you from being poor.</p>
<p>And when that system
that's meant to elevate us</p>
<p>is keeping certain people down</p>
<p>it's the antithesis
to what we think</p>
<p>of when we think
about education.</p>
<p>And then,
we have to really begin</p>
<p>to ask ourselves
real tough questions.</p>
<p>But we're trying
to educate children</p>
<p>in a system, in a world,
in a reality</p>
<p>where there's
so much brokenness and pain,</p>
<p>and disregard
for who they are,</p>
<p>their pain, and their culture.</p>
<p>So, I think we really need
an overhaul</p>
<p>in how we even look at
what education means for us.</p>
<p>- And we know a lot of times
we find solutions looking</p>
<p>at other communities,
other school districts,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>Dr. Bell, we know you work
across the world, the country,</p>
<p>looking at different ways
people do research</p>
<p>to solve these kinds of issues.</p>
<p>Is there any district
out there anywhere</p>
<p>that's doing things well in
terms of addressing these issues</p>
<p>with Black and brown
students falling behind?</p>
<p>- You know there
are success cases.</p>
<p>My colleague
Gudiel R. Crosthwaite
is the superintendent</p>
<p>in Lynwood Unified,
which is in LA.</p>
<p>They have
community-based schools.</p>
<p>They have colleagues of color,
professionals of color</p>
<p>in those school buildings.</p>
<p>Notonlycolleagues of color,
but some.</p>
<p>They are committed.</p>
<p>They believe
that all those kids can learn.</p>
<p>They have tons of AP courses
in those high schools.</p>
<p>They are starting
with early Pre-K.</p>
<p>And so, they hold them tight,</p>
<p>and they treat them
with dignity,</p>
<p>and those families with
dignity the whole way up.</p>
<p>- Now Kaleem, you've built
a pretty unique environment</p>
<p>in One City.</p>
<p>What are some of the things
that you're doing</p>
<p>that you feel like
other districts can learn from?</p>
<p>- Well, there's
quite a few things.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it's
the number of our young people</p>
<p>that are coming to us who
are so far behind academically.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter
the grade level that they're at,</p>
<p>but it's even more depressing</p>
<p>when they come to you in 9th
and 10th grade and who have a...</p>
<p>We have a third of our kids
are at the--</p>
<p>somewhere between 1st and 4th
grade level in math and reading.</p>
<p>It's like you just pass them
along to 9th and 10th grade</p>
<p>without intervening to address
their real core challenges.</p>
<p>First six to eight weeks,
we get to know our kids.</p>
<p>Then we pivot
'cause we see where they're at.</p>
<p>We test 'em, we look
at what they're,</p>
<p>how they interact in school,</p>
<p>how they show up
as students every day.</p>
<p>And two hours in the morning
students are in math.</p>
<p>Two hours in the afternoon,
they're in language arts,</p>
<p>and it's not just
instruction all day.</p>
<p>The first part of that
is instruction at their level.</p>
<p>And then we bring in tutors
that we've trained.</p>
<p>We've trained
over 50 tutors to come in,</p>
<p>and work with them one-on-one,
no more than one-on-two</p>
<p>to help them
to get up to grade levels.</p>
<p>So we have a personalized
learning environment for them</p>
<p>so we can move them forward.</p>
<p>So we won't be passing
kids in our school forward</p>
<p>to 9th and 10th grade
who aren't ready to be there.</p>
<p>- Dr. Gee, you've got one
superpower I'm gonna give you</p>
<p>to fix this problem.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do with it?</p>
<p>- We've got to really embed
the importance</p>
<p>of helping students to...</p>
<p>and I'll speak specifically
to our work</p>
<p>with African American children</p>
<p>with really understanding
and appreciating the culture.</p>
<p>You know, if we were to
go back in time 60 years ago,</p>
<p>we would not be having
this conversation.</p>
<p>Black people were going to</p>
<p>historically Black
colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Building historically Black
colleges and universities,</p>
<p>building churches
and businesses,</p>
<p>highly successful educationally
with integration.</p>
<p>And one of my mentors,</p>
<p>and she probably
has mentored all of us,</p>
<p>Dr. Gloria
Ladson-Billings has always said,</p>
<p>"But, Alex, remember,
with integration,</p>
<p>30,000 Black teachers
lost their jobs</p>
<p>'cause they did not,
they were not integrated."</p>
<p>- Seymour: That's right.</p>
<p>- Black students were,
Black teachers weren't,</p>
<p>and many of them
became domestics.</p>
<p>And so, we have to understand
that this is somewhat new.</p>
<p>Because again, 60 years ago,
we weren't saying,</p>
<p>"How do we educate
our Black children?"</p>
<p>We were probably asking,
"How do we vote?"</p>
<p>But Black children
were becoming</p>
<p>dentists and doctors
and nurses and professors,</p>
<p>and then something happened.</p>
<p>So my superpower would be,
let's get them in places</p>
<p>where teachers can relate
to them, understand them,</p>
<p>celebrate them, and where they
see themselves in textbooks.</p>
<p>I came to Madison advanced
in 2nd grade,</p>
<p>but I had a Black teacher
in 1st grade who told me</p>
<p>I was gonna be the president
of the United States.</p>
<p>She's 102 years old,
and we're still pen pals.</p>
<p>We're talking is if
we have to fix Black children.</p>
<p>What we have to
really ask ourselves is,</p>
<p>"How are we
breaking Black children?"</p>
<p>- So, we know most parts
of Wisconsin</p>
<p>have a very tiny population
of students of color,</p>
<p>if any at all.</p>
<p>So when you talk about the folks
that sit at home right now,</p>
<p>and say, "This has
nothing to do with me."</p>
<p>How do we get those
folks to have a stake</p>
<p>in this game to
make things better?</p>
<p>- I'd like to go back to
something that was said earlier</p>
<p>about the function
of education in,</p>
<p>and I'll say, a democracy.</p>
<p>This affects all of us,
every single one of us,</p>
<p>no matter what
our racial background is,</p>
<p>no matter where we live.</p>
<p>If we do not have democracy,</p>
<p>that functions with civility,</p>
<p>where people can consider
issues of science</p>
<p>in the public domain of policy
around all manner of things:</p>
<p>housing, power, you name it,</p>
<p>all the things,
social services, farm subsidies,</p>
<p>whatever it may be.</p>
<p>We need an educated citizenry.</p>
<p>That's what the country
was founded on.</p>
<p>So for me,
this is about all of us.</p>
<p>These are all of our children;
this is our country.</p>
<p>- And I would say
America's at risk.</p>
<p>If you produce children
who lack an interest,</p>
<p>and passion to solve the big
problems of today and tomorrow,</p>
<p>who's gonna be there
to solve them?</p>
<p>We have to focus on education
and make it, I believe,</p>
<p>our number one priority
in this country.</p>
<p>And if we want a country
that's not divided,</p>
<p>we also have to have
a education that unifies people</p>
<p>rather than divides them.</p>
<p>And so if we do those things,
we'll succeed.</p>
<p>If not, you know, our demise
is we already have signs</p>
<p>of what
it will look like.</p>
<p>- If we don't learn
how to work together,</p>
<p>and work for and with,
be educated by,</p>
<p>and educating people
who don't look like us,</p>
<p>we can't fool
ourselves in thinking</p>
<p>that we're ready
for a global market,</p>
<p>that we want to compete
in the global market.</p>
<p>And so,
we can't boast of having</p>
<p>world-class
school districts or universities</p>
<p>if we don't know
how to talk to people</p>
<p>who are from our own state
who look different.</p>
<p>And so, I think we have to own
the broader problem.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we can't boast
in producing people</p>
<p>who can compete internationally
for jobs,</p>
<p>or awards, or opportunities.</p>
<p>- Seymour: We'll have
to leave it there, Dr. Gee.</p>
<p>Thank you, sir.
- My pleasure.</p>
<p>- Kaleem Caire, thank you.
- Thank you.</p>
<p>- Dr. Courtney Bell,
we appreciate you.</p>
<p>And we thank you folks at home
for joining us as well.</p>
