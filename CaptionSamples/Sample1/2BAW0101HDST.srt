[gentle, dramatic music]

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,700
- Reverend Greg Lewis:
We have to talk about

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,967
that elephant in the room.

6
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:18,633
- Reggie Jackson:
Racism has been a part

7
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:21,133
of Wisconsin history
since the beginning as a state.

8
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:24,433
- Alex Lindenmeyer:
Gosh, as white folks,

9
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:25,733
we have so much to learn.

10
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:30,667
[somber music]

11
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:32,667
- Dr. Christy Clark-Pujara:
History can help us understand

12
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:34,167
why we are where we are.

13
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,967

27
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:14,300
- Hello, I'm PBS Wisconsin
special projects journalist

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,633
Murv Seymour.

29
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:17,833
In a series of special reports,
we take an in-depth look

30
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:20,167
at systemic racism
here in Wisconsin.

31
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:22,900
Its history across the state
is painfully complex

32
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:25,567
and opens lots
of old and new wounds.

33
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,167
In this first episode of
 <i>Wisconsin in Black & White,</i>

34
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:31,533
we take a look at history
and the criminal justice system.

35
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:35,800
- Professor Ion Meyn: There are
more Black Americans in prison

36
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,167
than white Americans right now.

37
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:39,133
That is, and should be,
completely shocking.

38
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,400
It is apartheid.

39
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,200
- Noble Wray: It takes a society

40
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,067
to look at this
in a different way.

41
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:48,500
- Secretary Kevin Carr:
That's a statistic

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,100
that I don't think any of us
should be proud of.

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,500
- Justice Jill Karofsky:
Oh, my God,

44
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,767
this is such a big problem.

45
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:58,200
- Murv: We ask the question,
"How did we get here?"

46
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,333
[door clatters]

47
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:05,167
[twinkling music]
[typewriter clicking]

48
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:14,100
- Jackson: Systemic racism means
that within that society,

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,600
you have factors
about people's lives

50
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,300
that you can predict
the outcomes of their lives

51
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,733
on the day that they're born,

52
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,400
based on the racial groups
that they belong to.

53
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,367
- Murv: Reggie Jackson
educates people about diversity.

54
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,900
- Racism has been a part
of Wisconsin history

55
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,900
since it began as a state.

56
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,400
I often times joke with people

57
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,967
that I call Wisconsin
"Wississippi"

58
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:38,700
because we generally think
of racism in the South.

59
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,933
- Dr. Christy Clark-Pujara:
Lincoln opposed
slavery's expansion,

60
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:46,167
not its existence.

61
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,467
- Seymour: Dr. Christy
Clark-Pujara is an author,

62
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:51,267
and she teaches
African American history

63
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,433
at the University
of Wisconsin- Madison.

64
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:57,233
- Systemic racism, much of it,

65
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,067
is an extension of the creation
of race-based slavery.

66
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:04,533
And race-based slavery
was created through law,

67
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:07,300
and that was done
in the colonial period.

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,267
- Jesus give you
some tough love.

69
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:15,100
Racism is huge
here in Wisconsin,

70
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,233
and it's worse
than it's ever been.

71
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:19,767
Milwaukee is kind of special.

72
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,667
This is the Selma of the North.

73
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:23,967
When I go to other places,

74
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:25,567
people don't even know
that Milwaukee

75
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,267
have Black folks living here.

76
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:29,067
Say, "There's Black folks
in Milwaukee?"

77
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:30,467
Yeah!

78
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:34,133
And they've been oppressed
like crazy. [laughs]

79
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:37,067
- Not surprisingly, the highest
demographic representation

80
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,300
of African Americans...

81
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,767
- Murv: University of Wisconsin
law professor

82
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,733
Ion Meyn teaches
race and the law,

83
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,833
civil rights,
and wrongful convictions.

84
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,433
- White society
is addicted to racism.

85
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:49,833
- Seymour: He has a lot to say
about the racial climate

86
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,467
in Wisconsin.

87
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:53,133
- I don't know
what makes Milwaukee

88
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,567
the most segregated city
in the United States.

89
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,067
It is.

90
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:01,367
And I don't know what makes
the practices in Milwaukee

91
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:06,067
generate an overrepresentation
of Black people in prison

92
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,967
so that it's the highest
in the nation.

93
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:12,767
If you're a Black person,
Black resident in Wisconsin,

94
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:15,167
you have a 12 times
higher chance

95
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:19,433
of being incarcerated
than a white Wisconsinite.

96
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,633
- Seymour: History tells us
the over-policing of Blacks

97
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,467
in Wisconsin
and across the country

98
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:26,100
dates back
to the end of slavery.

99
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,267
- When the 13th Amendment
to the Constitution

100
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,267
was ratified
in December of 1865,

101
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:33,700
most people never read
what it says.

102
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,967
- It abolishes slavery,
and then there's a semi-colon,

103
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:38,467
"Except for punishment

104
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,867
for those who have been
found guilty of a felony."

105
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:45,533
- It creates the ability
for you to be back in slavery

106
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:46,800
in a different form.

107
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,067
Something like loitering,

108
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:50,733
which had never been illegal
before, becomes illegal.

109
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,200
- Whistling in public.

110
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:56,333
Like, I mean,
like that level of nonsense.

111
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:59,133
Walking along a railroad track,

112
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:04,200
not being able to produce
employment papers on demand.

113
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,733
You steal a pig,
you go to prison for life.

114
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,067
- Instead of sending you
to prison,

115
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:11,433
someone who owns a plantation
or a mine

116
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:13,733
or some business
who wants some free labor,

117
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,100
they'll be able to come in
and grab you

118
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,933
and put you into that system

119
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,533
so that you're
not gonna go to prison.

120
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:21,700
Now you're gonna go back
and work for free.

121
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,200
- Society says, "Oh, my gosh,

122
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,967
Black people have a propensity
to commit crimes,"

123
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,833
versus what was going on,

124
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:31,767
which was they were
arresting Black people

125
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:35,467
for committing no crime, and
then sending them to slavery.

126
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:38,267
- Seymour: The small town
of Appleton

127
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:40,767
was once the center of one
of the most racist tactics used

128
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:44,167
across the country to keep
Blacks out of white communities.

129
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,667
- Meyn: Appleton doesn't really
have any Black people,

130
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:50,100
and if you asked people
in Appleton,

131
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,667
it's just because Black people
didn't wanna move there.

132
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,733
Black people lived in Appleton
before the 1880s,

133
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,733
and they attempted to join
a growing community

134
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,700
during the '40s and '50s,

135
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,867
but it was a sundown town
through 1970

136
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:06,433
and enforced by the police.

137
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,700
- Seymour: Sundown towns
were places

138
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,933
that didn't allow Blacks

139
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:11,900
and other people of color
after dark.

140
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,700
- Jackson: They were
all over Wisconsin.

141
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,833
- Seymour: Nearly 250 in all,
according to a database

142
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:21,167
created by Washington, D.C.
sociologist James Loewen.

143
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,900
- Dr. Christy Clark-Pujara:
So, Black people
can be there as workers,

144
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:27,267
they can come to fish
during the day,

145
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:29,067
but you'd better
be out by night.

146
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:32,700
- Jackson: Some places
had a horn that would ring

147
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,300
in the evening when it was time
for Black people to get out.

148
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,167
Some places literally had signs
on the side of the roadway

149
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,167
that said, you know,
"After the sun sets,

150
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,833
Black people,
you're not welcome here."

151
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:43,900
- Seymour: About that time,

152
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:45,533
the prison population
in Wisconsin

153
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:48,667
and everywhere else
begins to explode.

154
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,700
[dramatic trumpet music]

155
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:53,600
- Reporter: Six days of rioting

156
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,800
in a Negro section
of Los Angeles left...

157
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,067
- Meyn: After the Watts riot,

158
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,700
white people blamed Black people
for the problem.

159
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,967
The response was a call
for federal funding

160
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:06,967
to provide a more
robust policing of these areas.

161
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,300
We started to see
this war on crime.

162
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,067
- Sec. Kevin Carr:
I'm aware that the current
criminal justice system

163
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:18,067
has a disproportionately large
number of persons of color

164
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:19,633
involved in it.

165
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:22,367
It makes me somewhat
sensitive to,

166
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:25,800
hopefully, being able
to address the needs

167
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,767
of that population in a way
that is fair to everyone.

168
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,667
- Seymour: Former Madison
police chief Noble Wray

169
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:34,933
sits on the governor's
pardon board.

170
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:37,767
- The politics back then
was tough on crime,

171
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:41,100
tough on drugs, say no to drugs.

172
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,533
It was, you know,
a zero-tolerance approach.

173
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:48,200
- You're not going to hire
all of these police officers

174
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,367
for them to sit around
and do nothing.

175
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:51,767
- Meyn: It was
billions of dollars.

176
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:53,167
- Officer 1:
Open the ####ing door,

177
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:54,567
or I'm gonna break
the ####ing window.

178
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,967
- Officer 2:
Open the door, man.

179
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:59,100
- Meyn: It was changing the face
of corrections and policing.

180
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,800
- Officer 1: So if
you cooperate...

181
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,867
- All of that money focused
on those communities of color.

182
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,367
- You end up with
a disproportionate population

183
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:08,500
that are under
the criminal justice system.

184
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,767
- If you live in the quote,
unquote hood and poor areas,

185
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,400
you are policed in a way

186
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,633
that people in affluent areas
are not, right?

187
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:20,300
And so you are just more likely
to find yourself

188
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,200
in front of a judge.

189
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:27,700
- White individuals,
their cases get dismissed

190
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,733
at a rate 50% higher
than the Black individuals.

191
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:34,900
There's a higher rate
of sentencing Black individuals

192
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:38,967
for the same crime,
at every part of the system.

193
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,367
By the way,
there's a higher rate

194
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:41,767
of Black individuals
for the same thing

195
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:44,967
being sent to a higher level
of security prison.

196
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,833
And then there's a higher rate
of white people in prison

197
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,533
getting good time credits
than Black people.

198
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:52,067
If you look at every part
of the system,

199
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,900
it doesn't matter
where you look.

200
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,200
You're going to find
these drivers of disparity.

201
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,767
- Seymour: Today,
former governor Tommy Thompson

202
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:01,967
and others admit
building more prisons

203
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,367
was the wrong approach.

204
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:05,967
Now retired, Thompson
is a passionate advocate

205
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:07,367
for more educational
opportunities

206
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:08,933
for those incarcerated.

207
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,067
- The increased crime indicated

208
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,733
that we needed more prisons
at the time,

209
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,900
and which I accommodated.

210
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:17,867
But every time I did this,

211
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:21,467
I always tried to balance
on the other side.

212
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:23,333
I was big on welfare reform.

213
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:25,800
I was big
on workforce development.

214
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,267
I was big
on expanding education.

215
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:32,367
- Domineé Meek:
In February of 1992,

216
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:33,533
I had been expelled...

217
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:34,700
- Seymour: At age 15,

218
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,900
Domineé Meek received
a life sentence

219
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:38,067
for taking the life
of Warren Smith, Junior,

220
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:39,433
an innocent bystander.

221
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:42,500
Domineé believes he and other
Black and brown teens

222
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,667
receive harsher sentences

223
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,533
compared with whites
the same age,

224
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,067
convicted of the same crime.

225
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,400
- Domineé Meek:
When I was incarcerated,

226
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,967
I only met one person
that was white

227
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:53,867
that was sentenced as a juvenile
to life in prison.

228
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:56,333
They took Black boys

229
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,667
and said that
"Y'all are Black men."

230
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
And they punished us like men.

231
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:14,433
They don't do that
to white boys.

232
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,967
Not in the numbers.

233
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,367
They gave them help.

234
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:28,367
- In Wisconsin,
the number of, kind of,

235
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:31,033
criminal referrals
is three times higher

236
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:32,933
for Black kids than white kids.

237
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,067
- You got two or three
generations of Black parents

238
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:37,567
who have been incarcerated.

239
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,767
The majority of the people
locked up are Black and brown.

240
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:42,433
So when you got
the majority of us locked up,

241
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:44,900
you can't be a parent
from prison.

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,367
So when that child
looks for that,

243
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:49,100
only place he goes to get it
is in the streets.

244
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
So we need father figures
to step up,

245
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,233
somebody to be,
that I can call

246
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,500
at 2 o'clock in the morning
and say,

247
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,300
"Murv, I'm locked up,
can you come get me?"

248
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,567
Or "Murv, I'm scared,
can you come get me?"

249
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:05,167
Or "Murv,"
and when I disappoint Murv,

250
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:06,400
that still
is gonna love me

251
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,467
like Murv would love
his own children.

252
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,833
- Seymour: In 2020,
Domineé walked out

253
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:15,433
of Oakhill Correctional
Institution after 28 years.

254
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,300
He says he doesn't feel free.

255
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,967
- When I left prison
in September,

256
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,100
one hole was filled,
but one wasn't.

257
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,067
Warren can never come back
and hug his mama,

258
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,500
hug his baby girl.

259
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:35,367
I live my happiness,
and I live this life,

260
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:38,767
but I never forget about Warren.

261
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,400
The goal is to prevent
another Domineé

262
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,233
from killing another Warren.

263
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,533
- Seymour: Domineé
is a former student

264
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:50,067
of Odyssey Beyond Bars,

265
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,633
a college jumpstart program
at Oakhill.

266
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:53,800
Peter Moreno runs it

267
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,900
on behalf of the
University of Wisconsin,

268
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:58,067
out of four institutions
in the state.

269
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:00,233
- We've learned
through experience

270
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,700
that long prison sentences,

271
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,867
while they may be appropriate
for certain crimes,

272
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:07,133
are not appropriate
for a lot of crimes.

273
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,067
And long prison sentences,

274
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:11,933
combined with a lack
of programming in the prisons,

275
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,333
can be especially harmful

276
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,867
because we're keeping people
in an environment

277
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,533
where they're unable to learn,

278
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:21,300
unable to grow,
unable to socialize,

279
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,967
and then we're letting them
go back to their communities,

280
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:26,167
expecting them to do well.

281
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:27,967
- Seymour: Moreno encourages
a closer look

282
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:29,467
at the conditions
of neighborhoods

283
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,067
and fixing problems
leading to people

284
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:33,067
entering the criminal justice
system.

285
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:36,800
- We know how to deal
with many of these issues.

286
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,733
- Seymour: With the recidivism
rate of just over 31%,

287
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,433
Wray says there are
four support systems

288
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:44,167
proven to help close
the sometimes-revolving door

289
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:45,633
back to prison.

290
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,067
- Do you have a place to live
when you get out,

291
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,900
and is that place solid,
does it reinforce,

292
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,267
does it support you?

293
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,800
Two, do you have employment,
which is big.

294
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,067
Three, do you have the people
around you that support you

295
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:02,100
and that will help you in terms
of doing the right things,

296
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,567
making the right decisions?

297
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:06,133
And the fourth one is treatment.

298
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:07,733
- Wisconsin should be
less worried about

299
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,533
getting a bad rap
and more worried

300
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:16,633
about improving the lives
of the people in this state

301
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:19,900
who live
in our communities of color.

302
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,667
- Seymour: In 2016, Supreme
Court Justice Jill Karofsky

303
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:23,933
took part in a course called

304
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,500
"Justified Anger: Black History
for a New Day."

305
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,133
The program was run by the
Madison organization Nehemiah,

306
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,800
which focuses on strengthening
the African American community

307
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,133
in Wisconsin.

308
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:34,600
Justice Karofsky says
the course

309
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,867
on racial disparities
in the criminal justice system

310
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,567
gave her a new understanding
of how, at times,

311
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:40,933
the criminal justice system

312
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,133
unfairly impacts
people of color.

313
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:48,067
- This country was founded
by white men

314
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:50,800
who were well-intentioned

315
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,067
and who created a system of laws
and the Constitution

316
00:13:55,133 --> 00:14:00,500
that was built
on the idea of freedom.

317
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,167
But back in the late 1700s,

318
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:08,067
we know that they didn't mean
freedom for all people.

319
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:11,367
Because of that,
it has been the white majority

320
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:14,833
who has been in control
of so much of this country.

321
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:20,233
Business, of government,
of the financial world.

322
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,267
It is gonna need to be
leaders in those areas

323
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:26,467
that are going to have to help
make the change

324
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,267
that so many of us
wanna see.

325
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:30,467
- Seymour: Justice Karofsky says

326
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:32,400
inspiration from attending
"Justified Anger"

327
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,133
led her to bring the Nehemiah
anti-racism trainings

328
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:36,800
to other judges across the state

329
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,800
in the form of intense,
one-day sessions.

330
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,200
- Do you think that we have

331
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,467
too much emphasis
on race these days?

332
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:44,967
- No.

333
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:48,933
Most Supreme Court justices
don't do interviews like this.

334
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:52,633
The reason I am doing this
interview and I agreed to do it

335
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:58,067
is because I think, and I
believe, and I know, and I see

336
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,267
that it is a problem
in our state,

337
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:03,667
and maybe if I stand up
and sit here,

338
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:06,167
as uncomfortable
as it may be for me,

339
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:11,067
that that may help
be part of the change.

340
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,600
One of the ways we can do that

341
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,700
is to try to reach out
to our colleagues of color,

342
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,267
to mentor them,
to learn from them

343
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:21,067
because their experience
is very, very rich

344
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,067
and could be different
than ours.

345
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,800
And then, to help them succeed,
should they wanna run for judge,

346
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,600
or should they wanna ask
for an appointment.

347
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:33,267
- Seymour: Secretary Carr says
he sees a shift

348
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,900
from simply locking people up
for public safety

349
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,733
to providing more treatment,
more education,

350
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,333
more trauma-based care.

351
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:45,333
- We have started
to rely more on alternatives

352
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:49,167
to revocations,
such as short-term sanctions

353
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:53,200
and community-based programming,
and for instance,

354
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,933
like drug treatment referral
for minor possession cases

355
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:01,933
as opposed to sending
that person back to prison.

356
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:06,233
- Each of us needs to figure out
what is it that we can do.

357
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,733
If it's only one thing,
then it's only one thing.

358
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,867
- Alex: We really wanted to have
a brick-and-mortar space,

359
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,667
like, in the heart of the city

360
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,933
where people could
come together.

361
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:20,367
- Seymour: Short Stack Eatery
in Madison

362
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:22,400
serves up
a lot more than food.

363
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,933
- Alex: Gosh, as white folks,
we have so much to learn.

364
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,267
[bell dings]

365
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,467
- Seymour: Its owner says
their spot serves as an example

366
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,067
of how to help equalize
what they consider

367
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:33,167
the uneven intersections
of race and inequality.

368
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:36,533
- Alex Lindenmeyer: We're
definitely unapologetically

369
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:41,833
trying to become less and less
racist every day. [laughs]

370
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:43,200
That's our goal.

371
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,367
We figure if we can unravel
some of our racist tendencies

372
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:49,833
and indoctrinations,
everybody can.

373
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,100
- Seymour: At her restaurant,

374
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,500
Lindenmeyer's job applications
look different.

375
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,667
There is no box to check
if you have a felony conviction.

376
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,733
- The fact that we don't have
a box on our application,

377
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,167
and we don't do
background checks,

378
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:04,767
and we don't do drug testing,
and all those things.

379
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:07,767
- Seymour: For years, they have
also routinely sent its managers

380
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:11,333
to the Nehemiah's nine-week
"Justified Anger" course.

381
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:14,467
- We have huge, huge systems
to figure out

382
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,533
how to disassemble
and reassemble,

383
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:19,067
and so it's gonna be
lifelong work.

384
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,800
- They said 92%
of our community

385
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,433
didn't even know that
there was a mayoral election.

386
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:27,700
- Alex: Black folks
can't do it alone.

387
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,900
They can't do it without us.

388
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,333
We're the one
causing the violence.

389
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:33,567
- Stop running people over here
out in these streets.

390
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,367
Stop shooting folks, man.

391
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:37,500
Yeah, they need to fix it.

392
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,500
We ain't gonna fix that, man.

393
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,933
We're the hated ones.

394
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:43,567
[gentle music]

395
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,067
- We continue
our reporting on race

396
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,900
and the criminal justice
system in Wisconsin.

397
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,333
We are here at Short Stack
Eatery in Madison,

398
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:53,067
and we are joined by the owner
of Short Stack Eatery,

399
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:56,067
Alex Lindenmeyer,
and we've also got Dr. Alex Gee

400
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,800
of Nehemiah's
"Justified Anger" project,

401
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,633
and Carl Fields,
who is with EXPO,

402
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,733
which stands for EX-
incarcerated People Organizing,

403
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,233
and he's also representing
Wisdom, a faith-based group

404
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,833
that operates out of the state
of Wisconsin.

405
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:08,433
Alex, I wanna start with you.

406
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,133
You mentioned,
during our pre-interview,

407
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:13,833
that you felt like
Wisconsin business owners

408
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:16,567
could do more to help
impact the disparity

409
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,400
that we see in the
criminal justice system.

410
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,067
What do you think
they can learn

411
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,800
from some of the things
that you're doing here?

412
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,600
And I'd love to hear what you
guys have to say about it, too.

413
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,700
- People that are
justice-involved

414
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,300
have so many things
that they're dealing with.

415
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,900
So employers need to internally

416
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:33,267
start having
the conversation about

417
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,500
what the criminal justice system
even looks like now.

418
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,733
If you're not justice-involved,

419
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,167
or you don't have
a family member,

420
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,800
or you don't have an employee
that's justice-involved,

421
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,500
it's designed on purpose
for you to not care,

422
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,067
for you to not know.

423
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,633
And so employers really need
to get educated internally

424
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:48,967
about what's going on

425
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,967
and what these barriers are
that people are up against,

426
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:53,167
and then figure out how
they can set up support systems

427
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:55,200
within their culture
and within their organization

428
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,800
to make sure people
get what they need.

429
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,467
- Yeah, we know that
you purposefully hire folks

430
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:00,800
that do have barriers.

431
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:04,800
Carl, how does that help folks
that are transitioning?

432
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,300
- To know that
there are companies

433
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,600
that are sticking
to what society intended

434
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,567
for criminal justice
to be is huge,

435
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,900
and that is tangible
to say, "Yeah,

436
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:16,800
"oh, you paid your dues,
come on.

437
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,100
"We, not only will we like
to work with you,

438
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,600
"but we'd be honored to

439
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,667
"because you got something
you wanna show,

440
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:23,867
you got something
you wanna prove."

441
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,300
And we're also
creating opportunities

442
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,733
that that's a real job,
you know, opportunity

443
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,500
to give to somebody who is
really in need of that.

444
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,700
- And Doctor, your organization
runs a re-entry program?

445
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,300
- Dr. Alex Gee:
It does; it does.

446
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,833
- And how do you see businesses
being able to impact things?

447
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:44,300
- If we want to attract large
businesses to this community,

448
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,433
where again,
there's low unemployment,

449
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,567
we have to help people
who are in this community,

450
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:51,967
wanting to work, willing
to work, to become employed.

451
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,800
So one of the things that we do
through our re-entry program

452
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,267
is we help to find jobs
for men and women,

453
00:19:57,367 --> 00:19:58,867
particularly men,
with our programming,

454
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:00,400
to find jobs, you know.

455
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,033
My vice president for re-entry,

456
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:03,567
a gentleman named
Anthony Cooper,

457
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:07,633
has placed over 1,000 men over
the past eight or nine years.

458
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:10,100
That's significant because
when you come out of prison,

459
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,133
and you have stable employment,
you can have stable housing,

460
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:15,600
which means you can live
a stable life in the community,

461
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,633
and it drastically reduces
the temptation to recidivize.

462
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:22,833
So we have a responsibility
to our own state's economy

463
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:24,900
and to the well-being
of good people.

464
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,133
We need them in order
for our economy to be stronger

465
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:28,300
in this community.

466
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,300
- I would love to hear
what you folks think

467
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,500
are some of the
biggest challenges

468
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,667
facing our criminal justice
system.

469
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,600
- You know, when we talk about,
you know,

470
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,200
alternatives to whether it be
a deferment program

471
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,800
through the court on pretrial,

472
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,267
or during incarceration,
or post-incarceration,

473
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:45,567
those programs,
those options that come up

474
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:49,033
are always met
with a zero margin of error.

475
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:50,700
And that is so problematic to me

476
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,233
because the current system
and what it produces

477
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:57,433
is not held to any sort
of standard on that level,

478
00:20:57,533 --> 00:21:01,567
but in fact, does have
a low effectiveness rate.

479
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:06,233
But we can't seem to take some
chances to try something else

480
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,467
because it's not politically
advantageous always.

481
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:14,400
It's not classy; it's not sexy.

482
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,267
- What role do you think
our federal government

483
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:19,800
and our state government,
what role do you think they play

484
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,633
in affecting the
criminal justice system

485
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:23,900
here in the state?

486
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,867
- I think that these
governmental agencies

487
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27,600
need to really own up

488
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,133
to the fact that
this criminal system

489
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,900
is really producing what
it was designed to produce,

490
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:33,433
this ugly, ugly cycle.

491
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:35,200
It needs to be called out
and dismantled

492
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,733
so we can build something
that's equitable

493
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,367
and that really
does rehabilitate.

494
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,700
- The history
of how systems were built

495
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,467
and what they were built for,

496
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:46,867
that plays out, continues
to play out even to this day,

497
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:48,367
a hundred-plus years later,

498
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:52,067
and that is a weight on any
person who enters the system.

499
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:55,200
As an ex-knucklehead myself,
turned professional,

500
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,300
I messed up in life,
I made some poor choices,

501
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,233
but no one anywhere
in the criminal justice system

502
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,133
told me that felonies
were gonna be forever.

503
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:09,700
I've seen that the barriers
just continue,

504
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,267
seen that no matter what I do

505
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:14,867
or how much of a great effort
I put forward,

506
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:20,267
society's still allowed to
socially acceptably mistreat me.

507
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:23,300
- You could buy someone a house
and send them to college

508
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,933
for what it costs, you know,

509
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:26,733
at least put a down payment
on a house,

510
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:27,933
for what it costs
to incarcerate.

511
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:29,533
So what are we
really trying to do?

512
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:31,600
We have the money;
why are we locking people up

513
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,067
when we could use resources
or redirect them

514
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,133
to really help people
out of a hole?

515
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:41,233
- I learned in my reporting the
term 'crimeless revocations.'

516
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,067
I'd love to get you to,
you know,

517
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,300
let our viewers know
what it exactly means

518
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,333
and how it leads and feeds
the pipeline to prison.

519
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:53,833
- The working definition
of a crimeless revocation

520
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:55,667
is placing a person into prison

521
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:58,867
or placing a person
back into incarceration

522
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:00,567
for not having
committed a new crime,

523
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:03,967
but for a technical violation
or rules violation of some kind.

524
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:07,133
- The way that plays out
specifically is perhaps

525
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:09,533
you bought a car and didn't
get it cleared with your agent.

526
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:10,933
- Alex: Yeah,
you used a computer.

527
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:12,167
- You used a computer.

528
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,500
You got married
and didn't ask for permission.

529
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,567
I know that
those are some extreme things,

530
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,733
but I know folks who have
feared for their lives

531
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,500
or their freedom for doing
things just like that.

532
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,733
But just think about this,

533
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,733
the crazy numbers,
to Alex's point,

534
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:28,267
of people in prison
are folks who have returned

535
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,933
on technicalities.

536
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:31,400
- We look at states like Oregon,

537
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,600
we look at states
like Washington,

538
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,633
that are putting huge dollars
into programs

539
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:38,133
of figuring out how to get
parents things they need

540
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:39,300
while they're locked up,

541
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,700
figuring out how
to get families reunited

542
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,067
while folks are locked up,

543
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:44,233
figuring how to get families
that have somebody locked up

544
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,767
the resources they need.

545
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:49,267
And our state has a lot
of catching up to do, for sure.

546
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:52,633
- Minnesota has a comparable
demographic to Wisconsin,

547
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:56,133
but they don't incarcerate
nearly as much as we do.

548
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:57,633
It really is big business.

549
00:23:57,733 --> 00:24:00,067
That's not just cliché;
it's really big business.

550
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:04,567
- Another learning process
I went through in this reporting

551
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:07,067
is I learned about language,
and I learned that

552
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,700
I'm guilty of saying some things
that, you know,

553
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,833
aren't humanizing people.

554
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:15,700
How important is
the language of incarceration?

555
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:21,100
- When we're talking about
felons or convicts or inmates,

556
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,100
you know, last I checked,
I was a person,

557
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,933
and I continue to be that.

558
00:24:25,067 --> 00:24:26,333
And so person-first language

559
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,667
is something
that we've been driving on

560
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,967
in this work that we do
for quite some time.

561
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:33,933
- It's the language that
helps us to reinforce barriers.

562
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:35,200
"This person can't be trusted,

563
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,700
"I don't want you
around my family,

564
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,533
you can't come to my church,
you can't work at my job,"

565
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:42,633
so it begins
with even the language.

566
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:44,400
And again, what it conjures
in our minds

567
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
about what this person
is capable of,

568
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,833
but when you use
those terminologies,

569
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:50,833
you don't really think that
they're really ex or former.

570
00:24:50,933 --> 00:24:52,400
It's just you did some time,

571
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,900
but you're still
in that same place,

572
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:55,967
and that's why
we keep that same title.

573
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:57,567
We just put ex in front of it.

574
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:01,100
- I have employees that go
to UW who are 19 and white,

575
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,100
and I have employees
who are 45 on paper,

576
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,067
and we have some disparities,
some differences,

577
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:09,567
and if we actually
wanna figure out

578
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:12,167
how to make this a safe place
for everybody to work,

579
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:14,533
it's a lot of internal
conversation about things like,

580
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:17,300
"Hey, you can't say convict,

581
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,467
you can't say felon,
here's why."

582
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:22,633
We gotta figure out
how we got here.

583
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:24,633
I can preach at you
all this stuff

584
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,300
about the lingo
and the language,

585
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,533
and why it's ineffective
or what have you,

586
00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:30,233
but until people
have a basis

587
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,700
or an understanding
of how we ended up here,

588
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,900
it's a moot point.

589
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,900
- And Dr. Gee,
how do we get all Wisconsinites

590
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:39,767
to get vested on this?

591
00:25:40,867 --> 00:25:42,667
- I don't even know
if that's my expectation,

592
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:45,433
but if I can have an impact
on employers

593
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:46,667
and their new employees,

594
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:50,067
or individuals who want
to make a difference.

595
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,400
When you invest in people
who wanna make a difference,

596
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,400
you trust
in a ripple effect.

597
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,800
But I've learned
that if I want

598
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,500
to live a healthier
and longer life,

599
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,300
I can't keep beating my head
against the wall

600
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,500
for people who wanna
argue these points.

601
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,733
I need to take the time
to invest in people

602
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:06,333
who wanna be allies,
who wanna speak out,

603
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:08,500
and who want to make sure
that everyone

604
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,300
has judicial justice
in their lives.

605
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,100
And so I try to invest
in the people

606
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,900
who want to be
a part of the change

607
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:17,100
and hope that,
at some point,

608
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,600
we will have an impact
on Wisconsin,

609
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,333
but I don't go after
the whole state.

610
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:22,400
I just try to really
work with the people

611
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,067
who want to get it.

612
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:25,667
- We're gonna have
to leave it there.

613
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:27,500
Thank you all for being here;
Dr. Gee.

614
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,667
- My pleasure.

615
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:29,833
- Mr. Fields.
- Sir.

616
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:31,067
- Alex Lindenmeyer,

617
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,600
on behalf of PBS Wisconsin
and our crew,

618
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,667
we appreciate you
for providing a space for us

619
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:36,133
to have this
important conversation.

620
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:37,300
- My pleasure.

621
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
- And we thank you folks
for joining us, too.

622
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:46,300
[somber music]

623
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,300
In this episode
of <i>Wisconsin in Black & White,</i>

624
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,967
we took a look
at the history

625
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,633
of race and education
in this state.

626
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:54,567
Educators and students weigh in
on longtime challenges

627
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,567
Black and brown students face
in the classrooms

628
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:57,900
throughout Wisconsin,

629
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:59,500
and we hear about
the work being done

630
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,233
to increase opportunity

631
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,700
and put all students
on equal footing.

632
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,300
[children laughing]

633
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,967
[teacher sounds out letter 'D']
- Children: Oh.

634
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:09,767
 <i>- Look at how Black students are</i>
 <i>doing.</i>

635
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:13,467
It is... terrible.

636
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:16,633
[gentle, somber music]

637
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:22,900
- Whatever efforts there have
been by the federal government

638
00:27:23,067 --> 00:27:25,433
to create integrated schools
have not worked.

639
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:33,567
- Education is the conduit
to freedom.

640
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:35,900
- We have a lot more work
to do.

641
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:37,100
- Murv Seymour: Wisconsin.

642
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,067
- We're a microcosm
of the nation.

643
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,533
- We want to create change.

644
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:42,200
- Seymour: A conversation
about race and education

645
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,367
in this state.

646
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:45,433
- It is a complex one.

647
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:50,200
We've never given full
education access to everyone.

648
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,100
- Seymour:
Author and retired University of
Wisconsin Education Professor,

649
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,533
Dr. Gloria Ladson-Billings,
travels the world

650
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:59,067
learning, teaching, and
training people about education.

651
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:02,133
- It's Thomas Jefferson
who says,

652
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:06,267
"Listen, we are not gonna be
able to maintain a democracy

653
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:11,067
unless the common folks
are educated."

654
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,400
- It goes all the way
to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

655
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,800
- Seymour:
Dr. Christy Clark-Pujara

656
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,700
is a UW-Madison
history professor,

657
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,300
and also works with the
Madison Organization, Nehemiah.

658
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,067
She's an instructor
in its Justified Anger

659
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:25,433
"Black History
for a New Day" course.

660
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:27,133
Nehemiah focuses
on strengthening

661
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:29,267
the African American community
in Wisconsin.

662
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:31,233
The nine-week course
teaches people

663
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:34,067
about race, history,
and justice.

664
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:36,600
She and Ladson-Billings help
explain why the playing field

665
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,067
of education began to take shape

666
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:40,800
out of balance
across the country,

667
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,600
including here in Wisconsin.

668
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,067
- Dr. Christy Clark-Pujara:
The laws against
teaching enslaved people to read

669
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:49,700
actually come into play

670
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,667
after the founding
of the nation,

671
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:56,733
in response to
enslaved people

672
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:59,100
doing things
like forging fake passes.

673
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,133
- Seymour: Written by
their owners,

674
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:03,700
passes were required for
slaves to leave the plantation

675
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,400
for extra work or errands.

676
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,333
- When we're talking
about access to education,

677
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:13,400
post-slavery, you just have
cities, states,

678
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,067
and counties

679
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:19,433
not investing
in the education

680
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:21,833
of Black people,
who are taxpayers.

681
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:24,333
They would have
inferior school buildings,

682
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:29,200
inferior materials, inferior
books, or notebooks, right?

683
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,933
The teachers
were paid less.

684
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:34,533
And so, it was
an active disinvestment.

685
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:36,867
My father was
functionally illiterate.

686
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:38,700
His family was poor,

687
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,100
and he was sharecropping cotton
most of his life,

688
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,467
and his labor was essential
to his family's survival,

689
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:50,833
and the school that
he could attend was underfunded.

690
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:52,467
- Seymour: During the
civil rights era,

691
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,633
Milwaukee was
the epicenter of protests,

692
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:55,800
demanding compliance

693
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,067
to end continued segregation
in schools.

694
00:29:58,167 --> 00:30:00,867
- We tend to think about
the Civil Rights Movement,

695
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:03,433
like the institution of slavery,

696
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:08,000
as something that is uniquely
Southern, and it was not.

697
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,533
- Seymour:
While the US Supreme Court's

698
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:11,600
 <i>Brown versus</i>
 <i>the Board of Education</i> ruling

699
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,933
in the late 1950s

700
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:15,333
ordered all US schools
to desegregate,

701
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:17,233
Milwaukee and other parts
of the state,

702
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:21,267
like much of the nation,
didn't do so for decades.

703
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:25,667
- The schools in Milwaukee
are not in line

704
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:29,700
with <i>Brown versus the Board</i>
 <i>of Education</i> until 1979.

705
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,567
- Reggie Jackson:
The city of Milwaukee's
public school system decided,

706
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,367
"Well, we're gonna
build new schools,

707
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:36,467
but we're gonna build them
on the south side,

708
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:39,000
which is primarily
the white part of town, right?"

709
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,567
- The schools that Black people
have access to

710
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:44,633
were severely underfunded.

711
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:47,567
- Ion Meyn: What you saw
in Black communities

712
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:51,100
was a continual kind of
decline in the tax base,

713
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,833
and the ability to
support public education

714
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:55,200
in those communities.

715
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,000
- Seymour: A declining
tax base

716
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,567
due to declining property
values in housing like this

717
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:00,800
in Milwaukee.

718
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,500
- Housing policy
is education policy.

719
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,867
You go to the schools
in your neighborhood,

720
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:11,533
and we tend to fund schools

721
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:13,733
through property taxes.

722
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:16,467
Better than 60%
of Black and brown kids

723
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:18,733
still go
to segregated schools.

724
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,700
- Seymour: Schools in
the Milwaukee metro area

725
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,833
are more segregated
for Black and white students

726
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:25,300
than any other metro area
of the country.

727
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,133
That's comparing
Milwaukee schools

728
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,467
to those
in the surrounding counties

729
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:31,967
of Ozaukee, Washington,
and Waukesha.

730
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:34,567
- Whatever efforts there have
been by the federal government

731
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:37,233
to create integrated
schools have not worked.

732
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:38,633
- There are many white children

733
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:40,267
who go to all-white districts,

734
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:42,833
and nobody says, "Oh, this is
a segregated district."

735
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:45,400
They say, "This is
a good district."

736
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,400
If you look at performance,

737
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,733
Black and brown kids

738
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:51,233
continue to lag.

739
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,700
- Seymour: Those students test
below white students in math,

740
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,200
in the early grades,

741
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,867
and it's not just math.

742
00:31:56,967 --> 00:32:00,433
- It speeds
over a hundred miles an hour.

743
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:01,767
- Seymour: If there's
one indicator

744
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:03,533
of how students will perform...

745
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:05,367
- Woman: Reading proficiency
is important

746
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:06,800
across the races.

747
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,600
- Seymour: ...It's their ability
to read by 3rd grade,

748
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,067
and state assessments show
that just one year later

749
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:13,467
in the 4th grade,

750
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:16,867
reading scores for Black and
Hispanic students also lag.

751
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:19,067
- The most revolutionary
thing we could do

752
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,933
is teach these kids
how to read.

753
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:22,133
Whoa!

754
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:23,433
[leaf blower humming]

755
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:25,433
- Seymour: But educators
across Wisconsin are working

756
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:27,167
to reverse these trends.

757
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:29,300
At One City grade
school in Madison,

758
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,467
the focus on reading is key.

759
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:33,433
- Yeah! It kind
of continues on.

760
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:35,233
- Seymour: 3rd grade teacher,
Kirsty Blattner

761
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,367
teaches reading skills
at this public charter

762
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:39,133
where more than
80% of the students

763
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:41,933
are Black, Hispanic,
or multiracial.

764
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,667
Blattner is passionate
about making sure

765
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:46,433
her students embrace reading.

766
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:49,500
- Kirsty Blattner: I have a deep
passion for helping scholars

767
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,067
that are struggling
academically.

768
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:52,433
If you have a scholar

769
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:55,700
that doesn't feel confident
and comfortable with reading,

770
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,067
then they'll find other ways

771
00:32:58,167 --> 00:32:59,500
to sort of mask that.

772
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,567
Because no one wants to be seen
as not knowing.

773
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:04,467
Instead of, "I can't do this,
 <i>I can't do this yet."</i>

774
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,500
Instead of,
"I'm not good at this."

775
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,067
 <i>"What are you good at?</i>

776
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,733
 <i>Would you like</i>
 <i>to be good at this?"</i>

777
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:13,467
- Sara Shaw: America has trouble
talking about race, period.

778
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:15,167
- Seymour: Sara Shaw
researches education

779
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:17,867
for a nonprofit think
tank out of Milwaukee,

780
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:20,200
called the Wisconsin
Policy Forum.

781
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,433
- There's a trope
in literacy circles that

782
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:26,767
before 3rd grade, students are
learning how to read.

783
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:28,233
And after 3rd grade,

784
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,500
students are
reading to be able to learn.

785
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,833
Think of how many
of your daily activities

786
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:34,100
become more difficult.

787
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,167
Everything from reading
street signs, to menus,

788
00:33:36,267 --> 00:33:38,733
to engaging in the legal system,

789
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:40,633
or going to the doctor's office.

790
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:42,933
- Education is the
conduit to freedom.

791
00:33:43,067 --> 00:33:45,467
- Seymour: From grade school
achievement to high school

792
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:47,800
where one superintendent
can boast the benefits

793
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,367
of a diverse student body.

794
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:51,533
- Tremayne Clardy:
We're approximately
35% students of color here

795
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:52,933
in the Verona Area
School District.

796
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:54,167
We celebrate diversity here

797
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:55,400
in the Verona Area
School District,

798
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,400
and we understand
that a diverse clientele

799
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,667
in the students
that we serve

800
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:02,267
allows us to be
a better district.

801
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:03,933
- Seymour: Inside
the district's signature

802
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:08,133
$150 million high school,
Verona Area
school superintendent

803
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:09,800
Dr. Tremayne Clardy
is straightforward

804
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,867
about his commitment
and obligation

805
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,067
to create equity for
all students in his district,

806
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:16,533
especially those
that are Black and brown.

807
00:34:16,633 --> 00:34:18,767
- It is our responsibility
to move barriers

808
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:20,767
but never, never
lowering expectations.

809
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:22,600
- Seymour: While recent
statewide data

810
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,367
shows a gap
in the graduation rates

811
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:26,367
of Black and brown students
compared to white students,

812
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:28,300
Dr. Clardy and other educators

813
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,167
believe the difference in
achievement

814
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:31,400
has less to do with performance,

815
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,400
and more to do
with something else.

816
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,567
- It's opportunity.

817
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:35,867
It's definitely not skill.

818
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:37,433
It's not intellect.

819
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,833
There's not any other
internal barrier

820
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,633
on behalf of
our Black and brown students.

821
00:34:41,733 --> 00:34:43,133
It is purely about access.

822
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:45,967
- Seymour: Opportunity and
access are why this school

823
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:50,333
has windows in place of walls,
and wide-open common spaces.

824
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:52,433
- We are modeling, you know,
other students seeing

825
00:34:52,533 --> 00:34:53,867
that collaborative process.

826
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,567
We set up our
furniture that way.

827
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:57,167
We set up the classroom
structure that day,

828
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:59,700
because you know the power
of peer-to-peer interaction,

829
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,167
and what that means
to strengthening education.

830
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,100
- Carri: What is that thing
that's in you?

831
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,467
- Seymour: Meet guidance
counselor Carri Hale.

832
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:07,633
- There's no typical day

833
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:09,333
in the world
of a high school counselor.

834
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:12,467
- Seymour: In the spirit
of strengthening education,

835
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:14,667
in 2018, the district sent her,
and every other teacher

836
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:15,967
to the Nehemiah Justified Anger

837
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:18,067
"Black History
for a New Day" course.

838
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,600
- We really had to get
to the root and heart

839
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,933
of the history of the systems
that have caused

840
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:25,467
barriers that
we're trying to dismantle.

841
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:26,633
- Seymour: For Carri Hale...

842
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:27,833
- It just fed me.

843
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:29,633
- Seymour: ...the course
has been life changing.

844
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:32,100
- It's just grown in me
over the years,

845
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,700
and I realized at that time,
there was so much I didn't know.

846
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,533
It benefits me as an educator
so that when I'm working

847
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:39,133
with a student
who doesn't look like me

848
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:41,100
or their family
speaks another language,

849
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,367
whatever it might be,

850
00:35:42,467 --> 00:35:44,333
that I can
respect them and value them,

851
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,333
and see them, and honor them
for who they are

852
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:47,567
in this space we're in.

853
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:48,967
- Gerald Montgomery:
Well, I definitely struggled

854
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:51,333
trying to figure out who I was,
just like everybody else.

855
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:53,400
- Seymour: Senior Gerald
Montgomery says attending

856
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,800
this diverse high school

857
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,900
has made him more
culturally aware than ever.

858
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:59,500
- When I came here, it was
kind of like a cultural shock,

859
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,700
seeing not too many faces
looking like me.

860
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,767
- Seymour: It's one of
the reasons Gerald got involved

861
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:06,600
with the school's Black
student union group...

862
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,200
- It's just more of, like,
celebrating Black culture.

863
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,700
- Seymour: ...which anyone
can join.

864
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,067
- The first BSU year, it was,
like, small, like, 10 people,

865
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:17,233
when I was a freshman,
and now it's like 80.

866
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,967
And just seeing like that
group of Black folks around me,

867
00:36:20,067 --> 00:36:23,067
I feel like that really helps
keeping, like, that balance

868
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:25,433
of me going through school
and everyday life.

869
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:27,433
- Seymour: Gerald says
he plans to go to college.

870
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:30,100
If he goes to a University
of Wisconsin school,

871
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,633
he'll be one of
a few Black students doing so.

872
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:35,333
Enrollment numbers
show that in 1975,

873
00:36:35,433 --> 00:36:38,067
just 2.5% of students
were Black.

874
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:40,800
Nearly 50 years later,
their numbers in 2022

875
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,500
still make up just
2.9% of enrollment law.

876
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,333
While Professor Ion Meyn
believes the numbers

877
00:36:46,433 --> 00:36:47,600
should mirror the demographics

878
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,200
of the nation's Black population
of about 14%.

879
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,433
- If that gets to 3%,
is that progress?

880
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:57,767
No.

881
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:59,500
We're not close to progress.

882
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,467
We're not close to even
reckoning with our problem.

883
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:05,367
- Seymour: The UW System lists
diversity as a core value,

884
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:07,267
and its five-year plan calls

885
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:12,333
for boosting African American
enrollment to 15% by 2028.

886
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:15,267
- Dr. Equan Burrows:
College is a aspiration

887
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,967
that is not afforded to all.

888
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:20,267
It's our honor to serve

889
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:24,533
and be one of the only
majority-minority institutions

890
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:26,333
in the state of Wisconsin.

891
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:28,467
- Seymour: Dr. Equan Burrows
is the dean of students

892
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:30,533
at Milwaukee Area
Technical College,

893
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:33,067
where more than half
the full-time student population

894
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:34,700
are minorities.

895
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,333
- It's important that we
level that playing field.

896
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:39,600
Look forward to
being the mentors.

897
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,200
- Seymour: Dr. Burrows
runs a mentoring program

898
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,667
with about
a hundred Black male students

899
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:44,467
called
the Men of Color Initiative.

900
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:47,467
- The goals are
to educate and empower students.

901
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:49,500
- Seymour: The program
hopes to give students

902
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,967
like Jeremiah Crawford a
better chance to finish college

903
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:53,967
and keep pace
with other students

904
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:55,633
who eventually
gain their bachelor's degree.

905
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:56,867
- Just kind of depends on...

906
00:37:56,967 --> 00:37:58,733
- Jeremiah: I've always wanted
to go to college.

907
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:01,233
My home life was a shambles.

908
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,667
It was rough
having a father on drugs.

909
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:05,067
- Seymour: If that
wasn't enough.

910
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:07,333
- Jeremiah Crawford: High school
was a point where I started

911
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:09,667
to retreat into myself.

912
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:10,967
- Seymour: Jeremiah
has something else

913
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:12,900
that makes learning and life
more difficult.

914
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:14,700
- Jeremiah: My sickle cell
stood in the way.

915
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,300
- Seymour: He copes
with the blood disorder

916
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,767
sickle cell anemia.

917
00:38:17,867 --> 00:38:20,367
- The last thing that you
wanna do is pick up a book,

918
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,167
and my illness
would just take over.

919
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:25,233
The Men of Color give us
an opportunity to meet,

920
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:27,700
and share our emotions
and our feelings,

921
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,067
and struggles we're having.

922
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:30,833
- Seymour: When it comes to
reading...

923
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,433
- It's a skill that
a lot of people are missing

924
00:38:33,533 --> 00:38:34,867
in this day and age.

925
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:36,800
- Seymour: Jeremiah
knows its importance.

926
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,067
Every day he says he does...

927
00:38:38,133 --> 00:38:40,567
- About an hour to two hours
of reading.

928
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:42,800
I would set an alarm
for 15 minutes.

929
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,500
Read, stop reading,
take a break.

930
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,133
- Seymour:
He agrees with experts
like Dr. Ladson-Billings

931
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:51,067
who say, reading about
things you like

932
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,567
organically leads
to more reading.

933
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,900
- If you like self-help books,
you should look for that.

934
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,100
If you want to learn
how to work on a car,

935
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,500
you should read
those type of books.

936
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,367
- I think that's really good;
I liked it.

937
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:01,967
- Seymour: Hitting the books
is often new

938
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:04,733
for a population
that schools can leave behind.

939
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:07,833
People whose incarceration
cut learning short.

940
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:09,733
An innovative program
hopes to change that.

941
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:11,400
- There are many,
many justifications

942
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,433
for higher education in prison.

943
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:15,533
- You opened up a really
important conversation.

944
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:17,700
- Seymour: This college
classroom is inside a prison.

945
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,600
Odyssey Beyond Bars
conducts this college-level

946
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,200
English composition course
at Racine Correctional

947
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,233
and three other prisons
across the state,

948
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:27,733
on behalf
of the University of Wisconsin.

949
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,733
- Peter: It transforms
how they look at their lives.

950
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:32,367
Virtually all of our students
have reported to us

951
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:34,100
at the end of the class

952
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,567
that the
experience in Odyssey

953
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,933
has made them want to
take more college classes.

954
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:39,533
There are people in prison

955
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:42,767
who look around and think,

956
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:45,067
"I don't ever want
to be back here again,

957
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,433
"and I want to do something
about my life

958
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:50,133
that ensures that I don't."

959
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:52,767
- I gave the, quote
commencement speech

960
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:54,967
at Oakwood Correctional Center.

961
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:57,233
- Seymour: Each time,
Dr. Ladson-Billing says,

962
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,067
she'd ask one question.

963
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:03,833
- "Raise your hand
if you were ever suspended?"

964
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:09,000
I've never had less than
100% of the hands go up.

965
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:14,733
[gentle poignant music]

966
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:18,333
- Seymour: Suspensions
and expulsions from high school

967
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:19,833
can lead to what
has been called,

968
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:21,633
"the school-to-prison pipeline,"

969
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:23,833
and at the very least,
disrupt graduation,

970
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:25,367
and college attainment.

971
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:28,333
- Now the prisons
are having to go back and say,

972
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:31,300
"Listen, let's make sure
you get the education

973
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,767
you should have gotten."

974
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:35,633
- Seymour: If fixing
the opportunity gap

975
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,633
for Black and brown students
is a puzzle,

976
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:39,467
another important piece of it

977
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:40,800
is the shortage
of minority teachers.

978
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,833
- They talked about
how my dad would move out,

979
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:44,100
and how me and my sister...

980
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,000
- Our students want and deserve
to see someone

981
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,867
that looks like them.

982
00:40:48,967 --> 00:40:51,333
- Seymour: For his part,
Superintendent Clardy is proud

983
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:53,800
of his efforts in his district
to diversify its staff

984
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,967
with people like Kabby Hong,
Teacher of the Year.

985
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:59,100
- And then, if you look
at this paragraph.

986
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,700
For so many kids of color,

987
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,867
they've never had

988
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:06,233
a teacher of color.

989
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,700
A lot of the university programs
are not diverse.

990
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,067
So if your feeder pool
of teacher applicants

991
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,200
is not diverse,

992
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,667
then, of course,
you're not gonna have

993
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:16,633
a diverse
teaching workforce.

994
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:19,800
- Seymour: In 2020, researchers
at the Wisconsin Policy Forum

995
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,533
took an extensive look
into the racial diversity

996
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:25,467
of Wisconsin teachers, and
the student-to-teacher pipeline.

997
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,200
The takeaway...
- I want you to...

998
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,733
- Sara: [exhaling]
We have a lot more work to do.

999
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:31,267
- Seymour: Shaw says, ideally...

1000
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:33,900
- That the diversity of the
student body would be reflected

1001
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:36,600
in the diversity of
the teacher population.

1002
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,167
- Seymour: While almost one
third of students in Wisconsin

1003
00:41:39,267 --> 00:41:42,433
are students of color, only
about 6% of their teachers are,

1004
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,700
and many don't stay.

1005
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,067
- Teachers of color who come
into the workforce are leaving

1006
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:49,367
at a faster rate
than our white teachers.

1007
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:50,700
- Okay?

1008
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,867
- Seymour: Many educators
say a diverse teaching staff

1009
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:55,867
positively impacts all students
in a lot of different ways.

1010
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,567
- We see positive impacts
across everything

1011
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:00,333
from student motivation

1012
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:03,933
to strong student-teacher
relationships,

1013
00:42:04,067 --> 00:42:08,267
to absenteeism, graduation rates
and going on to college.

1014
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:11,367
- When you look
at the educational inequities,

1015
00:42:11,467 --> 00:42:13,767
I think it is
just intrinsically tied

1016
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:15,967
to the inequities
that are in society,

1017
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,833
but it's gonna take
policy changes--

1018
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:19,067
not just talk.

1019
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,467
- For his part,
Verona Superintendent Clardy

1020
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:24,233
is moving beyond talking
and taking action.

1021
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,900
- I'm not a worrier;
I'm a doer.

1022
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:27,933
And so we're about
doing the work.

1023
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:30,700
- We continue our reporting

1024
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,067
on race and education

1025
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:34,200
in the state of Wisconsin
here from the campus

1026
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,867
of the University of Wisconsin
in Madison.

1027
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:37,200
Here to continue
the conversation,

1028
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,800
we're joined by Dr. Alex Gee

1029
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,767
from the Nehemiah Center
for Urban Leadership
and Development.

1030
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:44,567
Mr. Kaleem Caire, Superintendent
of One City Schools

1031
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:45,933
here in Madison,

1032
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:48,333
and Dr. Courtney Bell,
who is the director

1033
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,600
of the Wisconsin Center
for Educational Research.

1034
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,700
As I've traveled and talked
to folks across the state

1035
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,367
about this issue,

1036
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:57,367
I get the sense
that it's a very touchy subject.

1037
00:42:57,467 --> 00:42:58,800
Is there something to that?

1038
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,333
- Race is a touchy subject
in the United States.

1039
00:43:01,433 --> 00:43:05,267
I think, when we think
about systemic racism,

1040
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:07,633
which exists in education,

1041
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:10,100
we think about these sort
of interlocking layers

1042
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,467
of systems and policies, right?

1043
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:13,267
So, you only need
to think about

1044
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:15,100
how do we draw
the district boundary,

1045
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,067
and the way that interacts
with the neighborhoods,

1046
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:20,300
the neighborhood
attendance zone,

1047
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,167
the teachers
the school can attract,

1048
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,633
the outcomes that then wind up
in that neighborhood,

1049
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:27,133
that those
are interlocking systems.

1050
00:43:27,233 --> 00:43:32,100
So, it is contentious, I think
partly because people do care,

1051
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,900
but the persistent inequalities
are hard to look at

1052
00:43:34,067 --> 00:43:35,233
in this state,
in particular.

1053
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:37,433
- Dr. Gee, why are people
afraid to talk about this?

1054
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:39,100
- Because I think
it's difficult

1055
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,567
to face up to the culpability.

1056
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:44,233
We like to quote statistics,
but we don't really want

1057
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,267
to look at our ownership
in the problem

1058
00:43:46,367 --> 00:43:48,267
or why we've allowed
it to persist.

1059
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:52,333
In educational services systems,

1060
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:54,533
we want to fight
against racism,

1061
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:56,633
but when we don't
properly address it,

1062
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:58,500
the educational systems
themselves

1063
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,233
become breeding grounds
for racism.

1064
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:03,067
And I think we just like
to pass the buck

1065
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:05,867
to someone else without
taking full responsibility.

1066
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:08,633
- I think they're both
absolutely spot on,

1067
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:11,433
but I also think that
we have divorced ourselves

1068
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:13,867
from the problem.

1069
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:17,167
That it is not only something
that I'm embarrassed

1070
00:44:17,267 --> 00:44:18,967
or don't want to be culpable in,

1071
00:44:19,067 --> 00:44:24,067
but it's been persistent
for so long,

1072
00:44:25,067 --> 00:44:27,600
and if I know about it,
I'm tired of hearing of it,

1073
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,633
and so, it brings me down.

1074
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,233
I've heard people say that,
like,

1075
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:34,467
"I can't focus on the problem
'cause it just brings me down.

1076
00:44:34,567 --> 00:44:35,867
"'Cause it's like
we've not solved it,

1077
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,267
it's not gonna be solved."

1078
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:39,300
And so, I think
there's a lot of hopelessness.

1079
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,067
I also think that we also
live in a state that,

1080
00:44:43,133 --> 00:44:45,467
by and large, has been
privileged for a very long time,

1081
00:44:45,567 --> 00:44:47,633
particularly in the area
where we are in Madison.

1082
00:44:47,733 --> 00:44:50,733
And so, when you're privileged,
and things are going okay,

1083
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:53,333
and you don't have to
focus on the issue,

1084
00:44:53,433 --> 00:44:55,667
you act like it doesn't exist.

1085
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:57,467
- But this lack of success
that we're seeing,

1086
00:44:57,567 --> 00:45:00,267
is it more to blame
on the teachers,

1087
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,767
or is it more to blame
on students?

1088
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:06,433
- I think there's enough blame
to go around, actually.

1089
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:09,700
But I think, if we ignore
the systemic issues,

1090
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,400
and only point fingers to the
parents, the students, teachers,

1091
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,900
not look
at the larger issue,

1092
00:45:16,067 --> 00:45:19,233
I think we continue just
to kick the can down the road.

1093
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:23,167
And so, I think we have to
look at really how we got here.

1094
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:26,067
I think what makes it
even more difficult is

1095
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,667
that education has been deemed
the great equalizer.

1096
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,233
Education is what brings you
into the mainstream,

1097
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:33,067
and it keeps you from being
discriminated against.

1098
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,533
It keeps you from being poor.

1099
00:45:34,633 --> 00:45:36,700
And when that system
that's meant to elevate us

1100
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,233
is keeping certain people down

1101
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:40,433
it's the antithesis
to what we think

1102
00:45:40,533 --> 00:45:41,900
of when we think
about education.

1103
00:45:42,067 --> 00:45:43,300
And then,
we have to really begin

1104
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,067
to ask ourselves
real tough questions.

1105
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:46,900
But we're trying
to educate children

1106
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:48,967
in a system, in a world,
in a reality

1107
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:51,967
where there's
so much brokenness and pain,

1108
00:45:52,067 --> 00:45:53,600
and disregard
for who they are,

1109
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,433
their pain, and their culture.

1110
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:57,433
So, I think we really need
an overhaul

1111
00:45:57,533 --> 00:45:59,800
in how we even look at
what education means for us.

1112
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,667
- And we know a lot of times
we find solutions looking

1113
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:04,400
at other communities,
other school districts,

1114
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,967
things like that.

1115
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:10,767
Dr. Bell, we know you work
across the world, the country,

1116
00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:12,333
looking at different ways
people do research

1117
00:46:12,433 --> 00:46:14,067
to solve these kinds of issues.

1118
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,333
Is there any district
out there anywhere

1119
00:46:16,433 --> 00:46:20,733
that's doing things well in
terms of addressing these issues

1120
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,967
with Black and brown
students falling behind?

1121
00:46:23,067 --> 00:46:25,100
- You know there
are success cases.

1122
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,333
My colleague
Gudiel R. Crosthwaite
is the superintendent

1123
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:33,100
in Lynwood Unified,
which is in LA.

1124
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,267
They have
community-based schools.

1125
00:46:35,367 --> 00:46:39,300
They have colleagues of color,
professionals of color

1126
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,133
in those school buildings.

1127
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:44,767
Not <i>only</i> colleagues of color,
but some.

1128
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:46,567
They are committed.

1129
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:48,633
They believe
that all those kids can learn.

1130
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:51,067
They have tons of AP courses
in those high schools.

1131
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,800
They are starting
with early Pre-K.

1132
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,067
And so, they hold them tight,

1133
00:46:56,133 --> 00:46:57,767
and they treat them
with dignity,

1134
00:46:57,867 --> 00:47:00,333
and those families with
dignity the whole way up.

1135
00:47:00,433 --> 00:47:02,133
- Now Kaleem, you've built
a pretty unique environment

1136
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:03,333
in One City.

1137
00:47:03,433 --> 00:47:05,267
What are some of the things
that you're doing

1138
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:07,167
that you feel like
other districts can learn from?

1139
00:47:07,267 --> 00:47:08,667
- Well, there's
quite a few things.

1140
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:11,200
First and foremost, it's
the number of our young people

1141
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,733
that are coming to us who
are so far behind academically.

1142
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,600
Doesn't matter
the grade level that they're at,

1143
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,967
but it's even more depressing

1144
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:21,067
when they come to you in 9th
and 10th grade and who have a...

1145
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:23,800
We have a third of our kids
are at the--

1146
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,733
somewhere between 1st and 4th
grade level in math and reading.

1147
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:29,633
It's like you just pass them
along to 9th and 10th grade

1148
00:47:29,733 --> 00:47:32,933
without intervening to address
their real core challenges.

1149
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:35,800
First six to eight weeks,
we get to know our kids.

1150
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,067
Then we pivot
'cause we see where they're at.

1151
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,667
We test 'em, we look
at what they're,

1152
00:47:39,767 --> 00:47:41,300
how they interact in school,

1153
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
how they show up
as students every day.

1154
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,333
And two hours in the morning
students are in math.

1155
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:48,800
Two hours in the afternoon,
they're in language arts,

1156
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,433
and it's not just
instruction all day.

1157
00:47:50,533 --> 00:47:52,767
The first part of that
is instruction at their level.

1158
00:47:52,867 --> 00:47:54,967
And then we bring in tutors
that we've trained.

1159
00:47:55,067 --> 00:47:57,100
We've trained
over 50 tutors to come in,

1160
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,867
and work with them one-on-one,
no more than one-on-two

1161
00:48:00,067 --> 00:48:02,133
to help them
to get up to grade levels.

1162
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:05,900
So we have a personalized
learning environment for them

1163
00:48:06,067 --> 00:48:07,400
so we can move them forward.

1164
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,700
So we won't be passing
kids in our school forward

1165
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,067
to 9th and 10th grade
who aren't ready to be there.

1166
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,300
- Dr. Gee, you've got one
superpower I'm gonna give you

1167
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,700
to fix this problem.

1168
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,167
What are you gonna do with it?

1169
00:48:18,267 --> 00:48:20,467
- We've got to really embed
the importance

1170
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:21,967
of helping students to...

1171
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:23,833
and I'll speak specifically
to our work

1172
00:48:23,933 --> 00:48:26,833
with African American children

1173
00:48:26,933 --> 00:48:29,833
with really understanding
and appreciating the culture.

1174
00:48:29,933 --> 00:48:32,633
You know, if we were to
go back in time 60 years ago,

1175
00:48:32,733 --> 00:48:34,367
we would not be having
this conversation.

1176
00:48:34,467 --> 00:48:36,167
Black people were going to

1177
00:48:36,267 --> 00:48:38,567
historically Black
colleges and universities.

1178
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,900
Building historically Black
colleges and universities,

1179
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:43,300
building churches
and businesses,

1180
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,633
highly successful educationally
with integration.

1181
00:48:46,733 --> 00:48:48,067
And one of my mentors,

1182
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,633
and she probably
has mentored all of us,

1183
00:48:49,733 --> 00:48:51,067
Dr. Gloria
Ladson-Billings has always said,

1184
00:48:51,133 --> 00:48:53,067
"But, Alex, remember,
with integration,

1185
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,767
30,000 Black teachers
lost their jobs

1186
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:58,700
'cause they did not,
they were not integrated."

1187
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,067
- Seymour: That's right.

1188
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:01,467
- Black students were,
Black teachers weren't,

1189
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:04,267
and many of them
became domestics.

1190
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:07,067
And so, we have to understand
that this is somewhat new.

1191
00:49:07,133 --> 00:49:08,733
Because again, 60 years ago,
we weren't saying,

1192
00:49:08,833 --> 00:49:10,200
"How do we educate
our Black children?"

1193
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,800
We were probably asking,
"How do we vote?"

1194
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,300
But Black children
were becoming

1195
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,800
dentists and doctors
and nurses and professors,

1196
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,400
and then something happened.

1197
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,733
So my superpower would be,
let's get them in places

1198
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:23,067
where teachers can relate
to them, understand them,

1199
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:27,733
celebrate them, and where they
see themselves in textbooks.

1200
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:29,333
I came to Madison advanced
in 2nd grade,

1201
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:31,733
but I had a Black teacher
in 1st grade who told me

1202
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:33,733
I was gonna be the president
of the United States.

1203
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:36,067
She's 102 years old,
and we're still pen pals.

1204
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:38,100
We're talking is if
we have to fix Black children.

1205
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,700
What we have to
really ask ourselves is,

1206
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,300
"How are we
breaking Black children?"

1207
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,267
- So, we know most parts
of Wisconsin

1208
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:47,200
have a very tiny population
of students of color,

1209
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,667
if any at all.

1210
00:49:48,767 --> 00:49:51,267
So when you talk about the folks
that sit at home right now,

1211
00:49:51,367 --> 00:49:53,067
and say, "This has
nothing to do with me."

1212
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:56,933
How do we get those
folks to have a stake

1213
00:49:57,067 --> 00:49:59,067
in this game to
make things better?

1214
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,400
- I'd like to go back to
something that was said earlier

1215
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,367
about the function
of education in,

1216
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,167
and I'll say, a democracy.

1217
00:50:05,267 --> 00:50:08,933
This affects all of us,
every single one of us,

1218
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:10,533
no matter what
our racial background is,

1219
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,067
no matter where we live.

1220
00:50:12,167 --> 00:50:13,767
If we do not have democracy,

1221
00:50:13,867 --> 00:50:15,567
that functions with civility,

1222
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:19,133
where people can consider
issues of science

1223
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:23,467
in the public domain of policy
around all manner of things:

1224
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:24,933
housing, power, you name it,

1225
00:50:25,033 --> 00:50:27,567
all the things,
social services, farm subsidies,

1226
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:28,967
whatever it may be.

1227
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,700
We need an educated citizenry.

1228
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,433
That's what the country
was founded on.

1229
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:34,867
So for me,
this is about all of us.

1230
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:38,000
These are all of our children;
this is our country.

1231
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,833
- And I would say
America's at risk.

1232
00:50:39,933 --> 00:50:44,267
If you produce children
who lack an interest,

1233
00:50:44,367 --> 00:50:46,900
and passion to solve the big
problems of today and tomorrow,

1234
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,367
who's gonna be there
to solve them?

1235
00:50:49,467 --> 00:50:52,800
We have to focus on education
and make it, I believe,

1236
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,533
our number one priority
in this country.

1237
00:50:54,633 --> 00:50:56,833
And if we want a country
that's not divided,

1238
00:50:56,933 --> 00:51:00,567
we also have to have
a education that unifies people

1239
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:02,167
rather than divides them.

1240
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,900
And so if we do those things,
we'll succeed.

1241
00:51:05,067 --> 00:51:08,767
If not, you know, our demise
is we already have signs

1242
00:51:08,867 --> 00:51:10,233
of what
it will look like.

1243
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,067
- If we don't learn
how to work together,

1244
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:13,767
and work for and with,
be educated by,

1245
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:16,567
and educating people
who don't look like us,

1246
00:51:16,667 --> 00:51:18,233
we can't fool
ourselves in thinking

1247
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:19,633
that we're ready
for a global market,

1248
00:51:19,733 --> 00:51:21,867
that we want to compete
in the global market.

1249
00:51:21,967 --> 00:51:24,733
And so,
we can't boast of having

1250
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:27,167
world-class
school districts or universities

1251
00:51:27,267 --> 00:51:29,133
if we don't know
how to talk to people

1252
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:31,633
who are from our own state
who look different.

1253
00:51:31,733 --> 00:51:34,467
And so, I think we have to own
the broader problem.

1254
00:51:34,567 --> 00:51:37,300
Otherwise, we can't boast
in producing people

1255
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,100
who can compete internationally
for jobs,

1256
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,767
or awards, or opportunities.

1257
00:51:41,867 --> 00:51:44,100
- Seymour: We'll have
to leave it there, Dr. Gee.

1258
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,167
Thank you, sir.
- My pleasure.

1259
00:51:45,267 --> 00:51:46,500
- Kaleem Caire, thank you.
- Thank you.

1260
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,500

we appreciate you.

1261
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,100
And we thank you folks at home
for joining us as well.
