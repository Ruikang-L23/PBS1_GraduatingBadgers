class="c2"><span class="c1">In a series of special reports, we take an in-depth look at systemic racism here in Wisconsin.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Its history across the state is painfully complex and opens lots of old and new wounds.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this first episode of Wisconsin in Black &amp; White, we take a look at history and the criminal justice system.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Professor Ion Meyn:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;There are more Black Americans in prison than white Americans right now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is, and should be, completely shocking.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It is apartheid.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Noble Wray:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It takes a society to look at this in a different way.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Secretary Kevin Carr:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;That&#39;s a statistic that I don&#39;t think any of us should be proud of.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Justice Jill Karofsky:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Oh, my God, this is such a big problem.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Murv:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;We ask the question, &quot;How did we get here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">[door clatters]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">[twinkling music]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">[typewriter clicking]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jackson:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Systemic racism means that within that society, you have factors about people&#39;s lives that you can predict the outcomes of their lives on the day that they&#39;re born, based on the racial groups that they belong to.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Murv:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Reggie Jackson educates people about diversity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Racism has been a part of Wisconsin history since it began as a state.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I often times joke with people that I call Wisconsin &quot;Wississippi&quot; because we generally think of racism in the South.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Clark-Pujara:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Lincoln opposed slavery&#39;s expansion, not its existence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Dr. Clark-Pujara is an author, and she teaches African American history at the University of Wisconsin- Madison.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Systemic racism, much of it, is an extension of the creation of race-based slavery.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And race-based slavery was created through law, and that was done in the colonial period.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Jesus give you some tough love.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Racism is huge here in Wisconsin, and it&#39;s worse than it&#39;s ever been.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Milwaukee is kind of special.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is the Selma of the North.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I go to other places, people don&#39;t even know that Milwaukee have Black folks living here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Say, &quot;There&#39;s Black folks in Milwaukee?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yeah!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And they&#39;ve been oppressed like crazy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">[laughs]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Not surprisingly, the highest demographic representation of African Americans...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Murv:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;University of Wisconsin law professor Ion Meyn teaches race and the law, civil rights, and wrongful convictions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- White society is addicted to racism.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He has a lot to say about the racial climate in Wisconsin.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- I don&#39;t know what makes Milwaukee the most segregated city in the United States.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It is.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And I don&#39;t know what makes the practices in Milwaukee generate an overrepresentation of Black people in prison so that it&#39;s the highest in the nation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you&#39;re a Black person, Black resident in Wisconsin, you have a 12 times higher chance of being incarcerated than a white Wisconsinite.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;History tells us the over-policing of Blacks in Wisconsin and across the country dates back to the end of slavery.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- When the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in December of 1865, most people never read what it says.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- It abolishes slavery, and then there&#39;s a semi-colon, &quot;Except for punishment for those who have been found guilty of a felony.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- It creates the ability for you to be back in slavery in a different form.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Something like loitering, which had never been illegal before, becomes illegal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Whistling in public.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Like, I mean, like that level of nonsense.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Walking along a railroad track, not being able to produce employment papers on demand.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You steal a pig, you go to prison for life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Instead of sending you to prison, someone who owns a plantation or a mine or some business who wants some free labor, they&#39;ll be able to come in and grab you and put you into that system so that you&#39;re not gonna go to prison.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now you&#39;re gonna go back and work for free.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Society says, &quot;Oh, my gosh, Black people have a propensity to commit crimes,&quot; versus what was going on, which was they were arresting Black people for committing no crime, and then sending them to slavery.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The small town of Appleton was once the center of one of the most racist tactics used across the country to keep Blacks out of white communities.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meyn:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Appleton doesn&#39;t really have any Black people, and if you asked people in Appleton, it&#39;s just because Black people didn&#39;t wanna move there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Black people lived in Appleton before the 1880s, and they attempted to join a growing community during the &#39;40s and &#39;50s, but it was a sundown town through 1970 and enforced by the police.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Sundown towns were places that didn&#39;t allow Blacks and other people of color after dark.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jackson:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;They were all over Wisconsin.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Nearly 250 in all, according to a database created by Washington, D.C. sociologist James Loewen.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Clark-Pujara:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;So, Black people can be there as workers, they can come to fish during the day, but you&#39;d better be out by night.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jackson:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Some places had a horn that would ring in the evening when it was time for Black people to get out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Some places literally had signs on the side of the roadway that said, you know, &quot;After the sun sets, Black people, you&#39;re not welcome here.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;About that time, the prison population in Wisconsin and everywhere else begins to explode.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">[dramatic trumpet music]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reporter:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Six days of rioting in a Negro section of Los Angeles left...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meyn:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;After the Watts riot, white people blamed Black people for the problem.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The response was a call for federal funding to provide a more robust policing of these areas.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We started to see this war on crime.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Sec.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kevin Carr: I&#39;m aware that the current criminal justice system has a disproportionately large number of persons of color involved in it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It makes me somewhat sensitive to, hopefully, being able to address the needs of that population in a way that is fair to everyone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Former Madison police chief Noble Wray sits on the governor&#39;s pardon board.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- The politics back then was tough on crime, tough on drugs, say no to drugs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was, you know, a zero-tolerance approach.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- You&#39;re not going to hire all of these police officers for them to sit around and do nothing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meyn:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was billions of dollars.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Officer 1:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Open the ####ing door, or I&#39;m gonna break the ####ing window.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Officer 2:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Open the door, man.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meyn:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It was changing the face of corrections and policing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Officer 1:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;So if you cooperate... - All of that money focused on those communities of color.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- You end up with a disproportionate population that are under the criminal justice system.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- If you live in the quote, unquote hood and poor areas, you are policed in a way that people in affluent areas are not, right?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so you are just more likely to find yourself in front of a judge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- White individuals, their cases get dismissed at a rate 50% higher than the Black individuals.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There&#39;s a higher rate of sentencing Black individuals for the same crime, at every part of the system.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By the way, there&#39;s a higher rate of Black individuals for the same thing being sent to a higher level of security prison.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then there&#39;s a higher rate of white people in prison getting good time credits than Black people.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you look at every part of the system, it doesn&#39;t matter where you look.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&#39;re going to find these drivers of disparity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Today, former governor Tommy Thompson and others admit building more prisons was the wrong approach.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now retired, Thompson is a passionate advocate for more educational opportunities for those incarcerated.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- The increased crime indicated that we needed more prisons at the time, and which I accommodated.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But every time I did this, I always tried to balance on the other side.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was big on welfare reform.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was big on workforce development.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was big on expanding education.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Domine&eacute; Meek:</span><span>&nbsp;In February of 1992, I had been expelled... </span><span class="c0">Murv:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;At age 15, Domine&eacute; Meek received a life sentence for taking the life of Warren Smith, Junior, an innocent bystander.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Domine&eacute; believes he and other Black and brown teens receive harsher sentences compared with whites the same age, convicted of the same crime.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Domine&eacute; Meek:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;When I was incarcerated, I only met one person that was white that was sentenced as a juvenile to life in prison.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They took Black boys and said that &quot;Y&#39;all are Black men.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And they punished us like men.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They don&#39;t do that to white boys.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Not in the numbers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They gave them help.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- In Wisconsin, the number of, kind of, criminal referrals is three times higher for Black kids than white kids.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- You got two or three generations of Black parents who have been incarcerated.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The majority of the people locked up are Black and brown.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So when you got the majority of us locked up, you can&#39;t be a parent from prison.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So when that child looks for that, only place he goes to get it is in the streets.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So we need father figures to step up, somebody to be, that I can call at 2 o&#39;clock in the morning and say, &quot;Murv, I&#39;m locked up, can you come get me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Or &quot;Murv, I&#39;m scared, can you come get me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Or &quot;Murv,&quot; and when I disappoint Murv, that still is gonna love me like Murv would love his own children.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;In 2020, Domine&eacute; walked out of Oakhill Correctional Institution after 28 years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He says he doesn&#39;t feel free.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- When I left prison in September, one hole was filled, but one wasn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Warren can never come back and hug his mama, hug his baby girl.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I live my happiness, and I live this life, but I never forget about Warren.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The goal is to prevent another Domine&eacute; from killing another Warren.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Domine&eacute; is a former student of Odyssey Beyond Bars, a college jumpstart program at Oakhill.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Peter Moreno runs it on behalf of the University of Wisconsin, out of four institutions in the state.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- We&#39;ve learned through experience that long prison sentences, while they may be appropriate for certain crimes, are not appropriate for a lot of crimes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And long prison sentences, combined with a lack of programming in the prisons, can be especially harmful because we&#39;re keeping people in an environment where they&#39;re unable to learn, unable to grow, unable to socialize, and then we&#39;re letting them go back to their communities, expecting them to do well.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Moreno encourages a closer look at the conditions of neighborhoods and fixing problems leading to people entering the criminal justice system.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- We know how to deal with many of these issues.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;With the recidivism rate of just over 31%, Wray says there are four support systems proven to help close the sometimes-revolving door back to prison.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Do you have a place to live when you get out, and is that place solid, does it reinforce, does it support you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Two, do you have employment, which is big.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Three, do you have the people around you that support you and that will help you in terms of doing the right things, making the right decisions?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And the fourth one is treatment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Wisconsin should be less worried about getting a bad rap and more worried about improving the lives of the people in this state who live in our communities of color.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;In 2016, Supreme Court Justice Jill Karofsky took part in a course called &quot;Justified Anger: Black History for a New Day.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The program was run by the Madison organization Nehemiah, which focuses on strengthening the African American community in Wisconsin.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Justice Karofsky says the course on racial disparities in the criminal justice system gave her a new understanding of how, at times, the criminal justice system unfairly impacts people of color.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- This country was founded by white men who were well-intentioned and who created a system of laws and the Constitution that was built on the idea of freedom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But back in the late 1700s, we know that they didn&#39;t mean freedom for all people.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because of that, it has been the white majority who has been in control of so much of this country.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Business, of government, of the financial world.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It is gonna need to be leaders in those areas that are going to have to help make the change that so many of us wanna see.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Justice Karofsky says inspiration from attending &quot;Justified Anger&quot; led her to bring the Nehemiah anti-racism trainings to other judges across the state in the form of intense, one-day sessions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Do you think that we have too much emphasis on race these days?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- No.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Most Supreme Court justices don&#39;t do interviews like this.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The reason I am doing this interview and I agreed to do it is because I think, and I believe, and I know, and I see that it is a problem in our state, and maybe if I stand up and sit here, as uncomfortable as it may be for me, that that may help be part of the change.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One of the ways we can do that is to try to reach out to our colleagues of color, to mentor them, to learn from them because their experience is very, very rich and could be different than ours.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then, to help them succeed, should they wanna run for judge, or should they wanna ask for an appointment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Secretary Carr says he sees a shift from simply locking people up for public safety to providing more treatment, more education, more trauma-based care.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- We have started to rely more on alternatives to revocations, such as short-term sanctions and community-based programming, and for instance, like drug treatment referral for minor possession cases as opposed to sending that person back to prison.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Each of us needs to figure out what is it that we can do.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If it&#39;s only one thing, then it&#39;s only one thing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;We really wanted to have a brick-and-mortar space, like, in the heart of the city where people could come together.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Short Stack Eatery in Madison serves up a lot more than food.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Gosh, as white folks, we have so much to learn.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">[bell dings]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Its owner says their spot serves as an example of how to help equalize what they consider the uneven intersections of race and inequality.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex Lindenmeyer:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;We&#39;re definitely unapologetically trying to become less and less racist every day.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">[laughs]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&#39;s our goal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We figure if we can unravel some of our racist tendencies and indoctrinations, everybody can.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;At her restaurant, Lindenmeyer&#39;s job applications look different.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There is no box to check if you have a felony conviction.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- The fact that we don&#39;t have a box on our application, and we don&#39;t do background checks, and we don&#39;t do drug testing, and all those things.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;For years, they have also routinely sent its managers to the Nehemiah&#39;s nine-week &quot;Justified Anger&quot; course.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- We have huge, huge systems to figure out how to disassemble and reassemble, and so it&#39;s gonna be lifelong work.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- They said 92% of our community didn&#39;t even know that there was a mayoral election.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Black folks can&#39;t do it alone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They can&#39;t do it without us.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We&#39;re the one causing the violence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Stop running people over here out in these streets.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Stop shooting folks, man.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yeah, they need to fix it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We ain&#39;t gonna fix that, man.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We&#39;re the hated ones.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">[gentle music]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- We continue our reporting on race and the criminal justice system in Wisconsin.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We are here at Short Stack Eatery in Madison, and we are joined by the owner of Short Stack Eatery, Alex Lindenmeyer, and we&#39;ve also got Dr. Alex Gee of Nehemiah&#39;s &quot;Justified Anger&quot; project, and Carl Fields, who is with EXPO, which stands for EX- incarcerated People Organizing, and he&#39;s also representing Wisdom, a faith-based group that operates out of the state of Wisconsin.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Alex, I wanna start with you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You mentioned, during our pre-interview, that you felt like Wisconsin business owners could do more to help impact the disparity that we see in the criminal justice system.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What do you think they can learn from some of the things that you&#39;re doing here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And I&#39;d love to hear what you guys have to say about it, too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- People that are justice-involved have so many things that they&#39;re dealing with.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So employers need to internally start having the conversation about what the criminal justice system even looks like now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you&#39;re not justice-involved, or you don&#39;t have a family member, or you don&#39;t have an employee that&#39;s justice-involved, it&#39;s designed on purpose for you to not care, for you to not know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so employers really need to get educated internally about what&#39;s going on and what these barriers are that people are up against, and then figure out how they can set up support systems within their culture and within their organization to make sure people get what they need.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Yeah, we know that you purposefully hire folks that do have barriers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Carl, how does that help folks that are transitioning?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- To know that there are companies that are sticking to what society intended for criminal justice to be is huge, and that is tangible to say, &quot;Yeah, &quot;oh, you paid your dues, come on.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;We, not only will we like to work with you, &quot;but we&#39;d be honored to &quot;because you got something you wanna show, you got something you wanna prove.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And we&#39;re also creating opportunities that that&#39;s a real job, you know, opportunity to give to somebody who is really in need of that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- And Doctor, your organization runs a re-entry program?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Alex Gee:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It does; it does.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- And how do you see businesses being able to impact things?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- If we want to attract large businesses to this community, where again, there&#39;s low unemployment, we have to help people who are in this community, wanting to work, willing to work, to become employed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So one of the things that we do through our re-entry program is we help to find jobs for men and women, particularly men, with our programming, to find jobs, you know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My vice president for re-entry, a gentleman named Anthony Cooper, has placed over 1,000 men over the past eight or nine years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&#39;s significant because when you come out of prison, and you have stable employment, you can have stable housing, which means you can live a stable life in the community, and it drastically reduces the temptation to recidivize.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So we have a responsibility to our own state&#39;s economy and to the well-being of good people.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We need them in order for our economy to be stronger in this community.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- I would love to hear what you folks think are some of the biggest challenges facing our criminal justice system.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- You know, when we talk about, you know, alternatives to whether it be a deferment program through the court on pretrial, or during incarceration, or post-incarceration, those programs, those options that come up are always met with a zero margin of error.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And that is so problematic to me because the current system and what it produces is not held to any sort of standard on that level, but in fact, does have a low effectiveness rate.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But we can&#39;t seem to take some chances to try something else because it&#39;s not politically advantageous always.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&#39;s not classy; it&#39;s not sexy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- What role do you think our federal government and our state government, what role do you think they play in affecting the criminal justice system here in the state?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- I think that these governmental agencies need to really own up to the fact that this criminal system is really producing what it was designed to produce, this ugly, ugly cycle.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It needs to be called out and dismantled so we can build something that&#39;s equitable and that really does rehabilitate.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- The history of how systems were built and what they were built for, that plays out, continues to play out even to this day, a hundred-plus years later, and that is a weight on any person who enters the system.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As an ex-knucklehead myself, turned professional, I messed up in life, I made some poor choices, but no one anywhere in the criminal justice system told me that felonies were gonna be forever.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&#39;ve seen that the barriers just continue, seen that no matter what I do or how much of a great effort I put forward, society&#39;s still allowed to socially acceptably mistreat me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- You could buy someone a house and send them to college for what it costs, you know, at least put a down payment on a house, for what it costs to incarcerate.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So what are we really trying to do?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We have the money; why are we locking people up when we could use resources or redirect them to really help people out of a hole?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- I learned in my reporting the term &#39;crimeless revocations.&#39;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&#39;d love to get you to, you know, let our viewers know what it exactly means and how it leads and feeds the pipeline to prison.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- The working definition of a crimeless revocation is placing a person into prison or placing a person back into incarceration for not having committed a new crime, but for a technical violation or rules violation of some kind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- The way that plays out specifically is perhaps you bought a car and didn&#39;t get it cleared with your agent.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Yeah, you used a computer.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- You used a computer.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You got married and didn&#39;t ask for permission.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I know that those are some extreme things, but I know folks who have feared for their lives or their freedom for doing things just like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But just think about this, the crazy numbers, to Alex&#39;s point, of people in prison are folks who have returned on technicalities.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- We look at states like Oregon, we look at states like Washington, that are putting huge dollars into programs of figuring out how to get parents things they need while they&#39;re locked up, figuring out how to get families reunited while folks are locked up, figuring how to get families that have somebody locked up the resources they need.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And our state has a lot of catching up to do, for sure.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Minnesota has a comparable demographic to Wisconsin, but they don&#39;t incarcerate nearly as much as we do.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It really is big business.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&#39;s not just clich&eacute;; it&#39;s really big business.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Another learning process I went through in this reporting is I learned about language, and I learned that I&#39;m guilty of saying some things that, you know, aren&#39;t humanizing people.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How important is the language of incarceration?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- When we&#39;re talking about felons or convicts or inmates, you know, last I checked, I was a person, and I continue to be that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so person-first language is something that we&#39;ve been driving on in this work that we do for quite some time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- It&#39;s the language that helps us to reinforce barriers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;This person can&#39;t be trusted, &quot;I don&#39;t want you around my family, you can&#39;t come to my church, you can&#39;t work at my job,&quot; so it begins with even the language.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And again, what it conjures in our minds about what this person is capable of, but when you use those terminologies, you don&#39;t really think that they&#39;re really ex or former.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&#39;s just you did some time, but you&#39;re still in that same place, and that&#39;s why we keep that same title.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We just put ex in front of it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- I have employees that go to UW who are 19 and white, and I have employees who are 45 on paper, and we have some disparities, some differences, and if we actually wanna figure out how to make this a safe place for everybody to work, it&#39;s a lot of internal conversation about things like, &quot;Hey, you can&#39;t say convict, you can&#39;t say felon, here&#39;s why.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We gotta figure out how we got here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I can preach at you all this stuff about the lingo and the language, and why it&#39;s ineffective or what have you, but until people have a basis or an understanding of how we ended up here, it&#39;s a moot point.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- And Dr. Gee, how do we get all Wisconsinites to get vested on this?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- I don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s my expectation, but if I can have an impact on employers and their new employees, or individuals who want to make a difference.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When you invest in people who wanna make a difference, you trust in a ripple effect.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But I&#39;ve learned that if I want to live a healthier and longer life, I can&#39;t keep beating my head against the wall for people who wanna argue these points.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I need to take the time to invest in people who wanna be allies, who wanna speak out, and who want to make sure that everyone has judicial justice in their lives.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so I try to invest in the people who want to be a part of the change and hope that, at some point, we will have an impact on Wisconsin, but I don&#39;t go after the whole state.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I just try to really work with the people who want to get it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- We&#39;re gonna have to leave it there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thank you all for being here; Dr. Gee.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- My pleasure.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Mr. Fields.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Sir.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Alex Lindenmeyer, on behalf of PBS Wisconsin and our crew, we appreciate you for providing a space for us to have this important conversation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- My pleasure.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- And we thank you folks for joining us, too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span
