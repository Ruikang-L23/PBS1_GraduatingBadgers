<p>- Hello, I'm PBS Wisconsin
special projects journalist</p>
<p>Murv Seymour.</p>
<p>In a series of special reports,
we take an in-depth look</p>
<p>at systemic racism
here in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Its history across the state
is painfully complex</p>
<p>and opens lots
of old and new wounds.</p>
<p>In this first episode of
Wisconsin in Black & White,</p>
<p>we take a look at history
and the criminal justice system.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ion Meyn:</b> There are
more Black Americans in prison</p>
<p>than white Americans right now.</p>
<p>That is, and should be,
completely shocking.</p>
<p>It is apartheid.</p>
<p><b>Noble Wray:</b> It takes a society</p>
<p>to look at this
in a different way.</p>
<p><b>Secretary Kevin Carr:</b>
That's a statistic</p>
<p>that I don't think any of us
should be proud of.</p>
<p><b>Justice Jill Karofsky:</b>
Oh, my God,</p>
<p>this is such a big problem.</p>
<p><b>Murv:</b> We ask the question,
"How did we get here?"</p>

<p><b>Jackson:</b> Systemic racism means
that within that society,</p>
<p>you have factors
about people's lives</p>
<p>that you can predict
the outcomes of their lives</p>
<p>on the day that they're born,</p>
<p>based on the racial groups
that they belong to.</p>
<p><b>Murv:</b> Reggie Jackson
educates people about diversity.</p>
<p>- Racism has been a part
of Wisconsin history</p>
<p>since it began as a state.</p>
<p>I often times joke with people</p>
<p>that I call Wisconsin
"Wississippi"</p>
<p>because we generally think
of racism in the South.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Christy Clark-Pujara:</b>
Lincoln opposed
slavery's expansion,</p>
<p>not its existence.</p>
