class="c0"><span class="c1">In a series of special reports, we take an in-depth look at systemic racism here in Wisconsin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its history across the state is painfully complex and opens lots of old and new wounds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this episode of Wisconsin in Black &amp; White, we took a look at the history of race and education in this state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Educators and students weigh in on longtime challenges Black and brown students face in the classrooms throughout Wisconsin, and we hear about the work being done to increase opportunity and put all students on equal footing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">[children laughing]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">[teacher sounds

doing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is... terrible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">[gentle, somber music]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Whatever efforts there have been by the federal government to create integrated schools have not worked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Education is the conduit to freedom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- We have a lot more work to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Murv:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Wisconsin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- We&#39;re a microcosm of the nation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- We want to create change.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A conversation about race and education in this state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- It is a complex one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&#39;ve never given full education access to everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Author and retired University of Wisconsin Education Professor, Dr. Gloria Ladson-Billings, travels the world learning, teaching, and training people about education.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- It&#39;s Thomas Jefferson who says, &quot;Listen, we are not gonna be able to maintain a democracy unless the common folks are educated.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- It goes all the way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Dr. Clark-Pujara is a UW-Madison history professor, and also works with the Madison Organization, Nehemiah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&#39;s an instructor in its Justified Anger &quot;Black History for a New Day&quot; course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nehemiah focuses on strengthening the African American community in Wisconsin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The nine-week course teaches people about race, history, and justice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She and Ladson-Billings help explain why the playing field of education began to take shape out of balance across the country, including here in Wisconsin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dr. Clark-Pujara:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The laws against teaching enslaved people to read actually come into play after the founding of the nation, in response to enslaved people doing things like forging fake passes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Written by their owners, passes were required for slaves to leave the plantation for extra work or errands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- When we&#39;re talking about access to education, post-slavery, you just have cities, states, and counties not investing in the education of Black people, who are taxpayers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They would have inferior school buildings, inferior materials, inferior books, or notebooks, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The teachers were paid less.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, it was an active disinvestment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My father was functionally illiterate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His family was poor, and he was sharecropping cotton most of his life, and his labor was essential to his family&#39;s survival, and the school that he could attend was underfunded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;During the civil rights era, Milwaukee was the epicenter of protests, demanding compliance to end continued segregation in schools.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- We tend to think about the Civil Rights Movement, like the institution of slavery, as something that is uniquely Southern, and it was not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;While the US Supreme Court&#39;s Brown versus the Board of Education ruling in the late 1950s ordered all US schools to desegregate, Milwaukee and other parts of the state, like much of the nation, didn&#39;t do so for decades.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- The schools in Milwaukee are not in line with Brown versus the Board of Education until 1979.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Reggie Jackson:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The city of Milwaukee&#39;s public school system decided, &quot;Well, we&#39;re gonna build new schools, but we&#39;re gonna build them on the south side, which is primarily the white part of town, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- The schools that Black people have access to were severely underfunded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ion Meyn:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;What you saw in Black communities was a continual kind of decline in the tax base, and the ability to support public education in those communities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;A declining tax base due to declining property values in housing like this in Milwaukee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Housing policy is education policy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You go to the schools in your neighborhood, and we tend to fund schools through property taxes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Better than 60% of Black and brown kids still go to segregated schools.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Schools in the Milwaukee metro area are more segregated for Black and white students than any other metro area of the country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&#39;s comparing Milwaukee schools to those in the surrounding counties of Ozaukee, Washington, and Waukesha.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Whatever efforts there have been by the federal government to create integrated schools have not worked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- There are many white children who go to all-white districts, and nobody says, &quot;Oh, this is a segregated district.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They say, &quot;This is a good district.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you look at performance, Black and brown kids continue to lag.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Those students test below white students in math, in the early grades, and it&#39;s not just math.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- It speeds over a hundred miles an hour.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If there&#39;s one indicator of how students will perform... - Woman: Reading proficiency is important across the races.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;...It&#39;s their ability to read by 3rd grade, and state assessments show that just one year later in the 4th grade, reading scores for Black and Hispanic students also lag.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- The most revolutionary thing we could do is teach these kids how to read.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whoa!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">[leaf blower humming]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;But educators across Wisconsin are working to reverse these trends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At One City grade school in Madison, the focus on reading is key.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Yeah!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It kind of continues on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;3rd grade teacher, Kirsty Blattner teaches reading skills at this public charter where more than 80% of the students are Black, Hispanic, or multiracial.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Blattner is passionate about making sure her students embrace reading.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Kirsty Blattner:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I have a deep passion for helping scholars that are struggling academically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have a scholar that doesn&#39;t feel confident and comfortable with reading, then they&#39;ll find other ways to sort of mask that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because no one wants to be seen as not knowing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead of, &quot;I can&#39;t do this, I can&#39;t do this yet.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead of, &quot;I&#39;m not good at this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;What are you good at?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Would you like to be good at this?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sara Shaw:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;America has trouble talking about race, period.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Sara Shaw researches education for a nonprofit think tank out of Milwaukee, called the Wisconsin Policy Forum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- There&#39;s a trope in literacy circles that before 3rd grade, students are learning how to read.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And after 3rd grade, students are reading to be able to learn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Think of how many of your daily activities become more difficult.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything from reading street signs, to menus, to engaging in the legal system, or going to the doctor&#39;s office.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Education is the conduit to freedom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;From grade school achievement to high school where one superintendent can boast the benefits of a diverse student body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tremayne Clardy:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;We&#39;re approximately 35% students of color here in the Verona Area School District.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We celebrate diversity here in the Verona Area School District, and we understand that a diverse clientele in the students that we serve allows us to be a better district.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Inside the district&#39;s signature $150 million high school, Verona Area school superintendent Dr. Tremayne Clardy is straightforward about his commitment and obligation to create equity for all students in his district, especially those that are Black and brown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- It is our responsibility to move barriers but never, never lowering expectations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;While recent statewide data shows a gap in the graduation rates of Black and brown students compared to white students, Dr. Clardy and other educators believe the difference in achievement has less to do with performance, and more to do with something else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- It&#39;s opportunity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s definitely not skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s not intellect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&#39;s not any other internal barrier on behalf of our Black and brown students.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is purely about access.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Opportunity and access are why this school has windows in place of walls, and wide-open common spaces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- We are modeling, you know, other students seeing that collaborative process.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We set up our furniture that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We set up the classroom structure that day, because you know the power of peer-to-peer interaction, and what that means to strengthening education.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Carri:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;What is that thing that&#39;s in you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Meet guidance counselor Carri Hale.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- There&#39;s no typical day in the world of a high school counselor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;In the spirit of strengthening education, in 2018, the district sent her, and every other teacher to the Nehemiah Justified Anger &quot;Black History for a New Day&quot; course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- We really had to get to the root and heart of the history of the systems that have caused barriers that we&#39;re trying to dismantle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;For Carri Hale... - It just fed me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;...the course has been life changing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- It&#39;s just grown in me over the years, and I realized at that time, there was so much I didn&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It benefits me as an educator so that when I&#39;m working with a student who doesn&#39;t look like me or their family speaks another language, whatever it might be, that I can respect them and value them, and see them, and honor them for who they are in this space we&#39;re in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gerald Montgomery:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Well, I definitely struggled trying to figure out who I was, just like everybody else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Senior Gerald Montgomery says attending this diverse high school has made him more culturally aware than ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- When I came here, it was kind of like a cultural shock, seeing not too many faces looking like me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It&#39;s one of the reasons Gerald got involved with the school&#39;s Black student union group... - It&#39;s just more of, like, celebrating Black culture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;...which anyone can join.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- The first BSU year, it was, like, small, like, 10 people, when I was a freshman, and now it&#39;s like 80.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just seeing like that group of Black folks around me, I feel like that really helps keeping, like, that balance of me going through school and everyday life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Gerald says he plans to go to college.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he goes to a University of Wisconsin school, he&#39;ll be one of a few Black students doing so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Enrollment numbers show that in 1975, just 2.5% of students were Black.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nearly 50 years later, their numbers in 2022 still make up just 2.9% of enrollment law.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While Professor Ion Meyn believes the numbers should mirror the demographics of the nation&#39;s Black population of about 14%.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- If that gets to 3%, is that progress?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&#39;re not close to progress.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&#39;re not close to even reckoning with our problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The UW System lists diversity as a core value, and its five-year plan calls for boosting African American enrollment to 15% by 2028.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dr. Equan Burrows:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;College is a aspiration that is not afforded to all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s our honor to serve and be one of the only majority-minority institutions in the state of Wisconsin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Dr. Equan Burrows is the dean of students at Milwaukee Area Technical College, where more than half the full-time student population are minorities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- It&#39;s important that we level that playing field.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Look forward to being the mentors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Dr. Burrows runs a mentoring program with about a hundred Black male students called the Men of Color Initiative.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- The goals are to educate and empower students.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The program hopes to give students like Jeremiah Crawford a better chance to finish college and keep pace with other students who eventually gain their bachelor&#39;s degree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just kind of depends on...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jeremiah:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I&#39;ve always wanted to go to college.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My home life was a shambles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was rough having a father on drugs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If that wasn&#39;t enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jeremiah Crawford:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;High school was a point where I started to retreat into myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jeremiah has something else that makes learning and life more difficult.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jeremiah:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;My sickle cell stood in the way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He copes with the blood disorder sickle cell anemia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- The last thing that you wanna do is pick up a book, and my illness would just take over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Men of Color give us an opportunity to meet, and share our emotions and our feelings, and struggles we&#39;re having.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;When it comes to reading... - It&#39;s a skill that a lot of people are missing in this day and age.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jeremiah knows its importance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every day he says he does... - About an hour to two hours of reading.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would set an alarm for 15 minutes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Read, stop reading, take a break.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He agrees with experts like Dr. Ladson-Billings who say, reading about things you like organically leads to more reading.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- If you like self-help books, you should look for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you want to learn how to work on a car, you should read those type of books.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- I think that&#39;s really good; I liked it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hitting the books is often new for a population that schools can leave behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">People whose incarceration cut learning short.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An innovative program hopes to change that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- There are many, many justifications for higher education in prison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- You opened up a really important conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This college classroom is inside a prison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Odyssey Beyond Bars conducts this college-level English composition course at Racine Correctional and three other prisons across the state, on behalf of the University of Wisconsin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Peter:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It transforms how they look at their lives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Virtually all of our students have reported to us at the end of the class that the experience in Odyssey has made them want to take more college classes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are people in prison who look around and think, &quot;I don&#39;t ever want to be back here again, &quot;and I want to do something about my life that ensures that I don&#39;t.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- I gave the, quote commencement speech at Oakwood Correctional Center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Each time, Dr. Ladson-Billing says, she&#39;d ask one question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- &quot;Raise your hand if you were ever suspended?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&#39;ve never had less than 100% of the hands go up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">[gentle poignant music]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Suspensions and expulsions from high school can lead to what has been called, &quot;the school-to-prison pipeline,&quot; and at the very least, disrupt graduation, and college attainment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Now the prisons are having to go back and say, &quot;Listen, let&#39;s make sure you get the education you should have gotten.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If fixing the opportunity gap for Black and brown students is a puzzle, another important piece of it is the shortage of minority teachers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- They talked about how my dad would move out, and how me and my sister... - Our students want and deserve to see someone that looks like them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;For his part, Superintendent Clardy is proud of his efforts in his district to diversify its staff with people like Kabby Hong, Teacher of the Year.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- And then, if you look at this paragraph.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For so many kids of color, they&#39;ve never had a teacher of color.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lot of the university programs are not diverse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if your feeder pool of teacher applicants is not diverse, then, of course, you&#39;re not gonna have a diverse teaching workforce.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;In 2020, researchers at the Wisconsin Policy Forum took an extensive look into the racial diversity of Wisconsin teachers, and the student-to-teacher pipeline.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The takeaway... - I want you to... - Sara: [exhaling] We have a lot more work to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Shaw says, ideally... - That the diversity of the student body would be reflected in the diversity of the teacher population.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;While almost one third of students in Wisconsin are students of color, only about 6% of their teachers are, and many don&#39;t stay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Teachers of color who come into the workforce are leaving at a faster rate than our white teachers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Okay?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Many educators say a diverse teaching staff positively impacts all students in a lot of different ways.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- We see positive impacts across everything from student motivation to strong student-teacher relationships, to absenteeism, graduation rates and going on to college.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- When you look at the educational inequities, I think it is just intrinsically tied to the inequities that are in society, but it&#39;s gonna take policy changes-- not just talk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- For his part, Verona Superintendent Clardy is moving beyond talking and taking action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- I&#39;m not a worrier; I&#39;m a doer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so we&#39;re about doing the work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- We continue our reporting on race and education in the state of Wisconsin here from the campus of the University of Wisconsin in Madison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here to continue the conversation, we&#39;re joined by Dr. Alex Gee from the Nehemiah Center for Urban Leadership and Development.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mr. Kaleem Caire, Superintendent of One City Schools here in Madison, and Dr. Courtney Bell, who is the director of the Wisconsin Center for Educational Research.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I&#39;ve traveled and talked to folks across the state about this issue, I get the sense that it&#39;s a very touchy subject.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is there something to that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Race is a touchy subject in the United States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think, when we think about systemic racism, which exists in education, we think about these sort of interlocking layers of systems and policies, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, you only need to think about how do we draw the district boundary, and the way that interacts with the neighborhoods, the neighborhood attendance zone, the teachers the school can attract, the outcomes that then wind up in that neighborhood, that those are interlocking systems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, it is contentious, I think partly because people do care, but the persistent inequalities are hard to look at in this state, in particular.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Dr. Gee, why are people afraid to talk about this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Because I think it&#39;s difficult to face up to the culpability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We like to quote statistics, but we don&#39;t really want to look at our ownership in the problem or why we&#39;ve allowed it to persist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In educational services systems, we want to fight against racism, but when we don&#39;t properly address it, the educational systems themselves become breeding grounds for racism.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I think we just like to pass the buck to someone else without taking full responsibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- I think they&#39;re both absolutely spot on, but I also think that we have divorced ourselves from the problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That it is not only something that I&#39;m embarrassed or don&#39;t want to be culpable in, but it&#39;s been persistent for so long, and if I know about it, I&#39;m tired of hearing of it, and so, it brings me down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&#39;ve heard people say that, like, &quot;I can&#39;t focus on the problem &#39;cause it just brings me down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;&#39;Cause it&#39;s like we&#39;ve not solved it, it&#39;s not gonna be solved.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, I think there&#39;s a lot of hopelessness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I also think that we also live in a state that, by and large, has been privileged for a very long time, particularly in the area where we are in Madison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, when you&#39;re privileged, and things are going okay, and you don&#39;t have to focus on the issue, you act like it doesn&#39;t exist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- But this lack of success that we&#39;re seeing, is it more to blame on the teachers, or is it more to blame on students?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- I think there&#39;s enough blame to go around, actually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I think, if we ignore the systemic issues, and only point fingers to the parents, the students, teachers, not look at the larger issue, I think we continue just to kick the can down the road.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, I think we have to look at really how we got here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think what makes it even more difficult is that education has been deemed the great equalizer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Education is what brings you into the mainstream, and it keeps you from being discriminated against.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It keeps you from being poor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when that system that&#39;s meant to elevate us is keeping certain people down it&#39;s the antithesis to what we think of when we think about education.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, we have to really begin to ask ourselves real tough questions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we&#39;re trying to educate children in a system, in a world, in a reality where there&#39;s so much brokenness and pain, and disregard for who they are, their pain, and their culture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I think we really need an overhaul in how we even look at what education means for us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- And we know a lot of times we find solutions looking at other communities, other school districts, things like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dr. Bell, we know you work across the world, the country, looking at different ways people do research to solve these kinds of issues.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is there any district out there anywhere that&#39;s doing things well in terms of addressing these issues with Black and brown students falling behind?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- You know there are success cases.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My colleague Gudiel R. Crosthwaite is the superintendent in Lynwood Unified, which is in LA.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They have community-based schools.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They have colleagues of color, professionals of color in those school buildings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only colleagues of color, but some.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are committed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They believe that all those kids can learn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They have tons of AP courses in those high schools.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are starting with early Pre-K. And so, they hold them tight, and they treat them with dignity, and those families with dignity the whole way up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Now Kaleem, you&#39;ve built a pretty unique environment in One City.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What are some of the things that you&#39;re doing that you feel like other districts can learn from?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Well, there&#39;s quite a few things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First and foremost, it&#39;s the number of our young people that are coming to us who are so far behind academically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Doesn&#39;t matter the grade level that they&#39;re at, but it&#39;s even more depressing when they come to you in 9th and 10th grade and who have a... We have a third of our kids are at the-- somewhere between 1st and 4th grade level in math and reading.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&#39;s like you just pass them along to 9th and 10th grade without intervening to address their real core challenges.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First six to eight weeks, we get to know our kids.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then we pivot &#39;cause we see where they&#39;re at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We test &#39;em, we look at what they&#39;re, how they interact in school, how they show up as students every day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And two hours in the morning students are in math.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two hours in the afternoon, they&#39;re in language arts, and it&#39;s not just instruction all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first part of that is instruction at their level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then we bring in tutors that we&#39;ve trained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&#39;ve trained over 50 tutors to come in, and work with them one-on-one, no more than one-on-two to help them to get up to grade levels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have a personalized learning environment for them so we can move them forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we won&#39;t be passing kids in our school forward to 9th and 10th grade who aren&#39;t ready to be there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Dr. Gee, you&#39;ve got one superpower I&#39;m gonna give you to fix this problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What are you gonna do with it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- We&#39;ve got to really embed the importance of helping students to... and I&#39;ll speak specifically to our work with African American children with really understanding and appreciating the culture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You know, if we were to go back in time 60 years ago, we would not be having this conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Black people were going to historically Black colleges and universities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Building historically Black colleges and universities, building churches and businesses, highly successful educationally with integration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And one of my mentors, and she probably has mentored all of us, Dr. Gloria Ladson-Billings has always said, &quot;But, Alex, remember, with integration, 30,000 Black teachers lost their jobs &#39;cause they did not, they were not integrated.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;That&#39;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Black students were, Black teachers weren&#39;t, and many of them became domestics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, we have to understand that this is somewhat new.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because again, 60 years ago, we weren&#39;t saying, &quot;How do we educate our Black children?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were probably asking, &quot;How do we vote?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Black children were becoming dentists and doctors and nurses and professors, and then something happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So my superpower would be, let&#39;s get them in places where teachers can relate to them, understand them, celebrate them, and where they see themselves in textbooks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I came to Madison advanced in 2nd grade, but I had a Black teacher in 1st grade who told me I was gonna be the president of the United States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&#39;s 102 years old, and we&#39;re still pen pals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&#39;re talking is if we have to fix Black children.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we have to really ask ourselves is, &quot;How are we breaking Black children?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- So, we know most parts of Wisconsin have a very tiny population of students of color, if any at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when you talk about the folks that sit at home right now, and say, &quot;This has nothing to do with me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How do we get those folks to have a stake in this game to make things better?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- I&#39;d like to go back to something that was said earlier about the function of education in, and I&#39;ll say, a democracy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This affects all of us, every single one of us, no matter what our racial background is, no matter where we live.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we do not have democracy, that functions with civility, where people can consider issues of science in the public domain of policy around all manner of things: housing, power, you name it, all the things, social services, farm subsidies, whatever it may be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We need an educated citizenry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&#39;s what the country was founded on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So for me, this is about all of us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are all of our children; this is our country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- And I would say America&#39;s at risk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you produce children who lack an interest, and passion to solve the big problems of today and tomorrow, who&#39;s gonna be there to solve them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have to focus on education and make it, I believe, our number one priority in this country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we want a country that&#39;s not divided, we also have to have a education that unifies people rather than divides them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so if we do those things, we&#39;ll succeed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If not, you know, our demise is we already have signs of what it will look like.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- If we don&#39;t learn how to work together, and work for and with, be educated by, and educating people who don&#39;t look like us, we can&#39;t fool ourselves in thinking that we&#39;re ready for a global market, that we want to compete in the global market.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, we can&#39;t boast of having world-class school districts or universities if we don&#39;t know how to talk to people who are from our own state who look different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, I think we have to own the broader problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Otherwise, we can&#39;t boast in producing people who can compete internationally for jobs, or awards, or opportunities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Seymour:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;We&#39;ll have to leave it there, Dr. Gee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thank you, sir.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- My pleasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Kaleem Caire, thank you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Thank you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Dr.
