[gentle, dramatic music]

4
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,533
- Reverend Greg Lewis:
We have to talk about

5
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:13,800
that elephant in the room.

6
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:18,467
- Reggie Jackson:
Racism has been a part

7
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:20,967
of Wisconsin history
since the beginning as a state.

8
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:24,367
- Alex Lindenmeyer:
Gosh, as white folks,

9
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:25,333
we have so much to learn.

10
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:28,433
[somber music]

11
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,433
- Dr. Christy Clark-Pujara:
History can help us understand

12
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:31,933
why we are where we are.

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,100

- Hello, I'm PBS Wisconsin
special projects journalist

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,833
Murv Seymour.

29
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:18,067
In a series of special reports,
we take an in-depth look

30
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:20,367
at systemic racism
here in Wisconsin.

31
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:23,100
Its history across the state
is painfully complex

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,667
and opens
lots of old and new wounds.

33
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:27,667
In this episode
of <i>Wisconsin in Black & White,</i>

34
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:29,333
we took a look
at the history

35
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:30,867
of race and education
in this state.

36
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:33,800
Educators and students weigh in
on longtime challenges

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,800
Black and brown students face
in the classrooms

38
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,133
throughout Wisconsin,

39
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:38,733
and we hear about
the work being done

40
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,267
to increase opportunity

41
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,733
and put all students
on equal footing.

42
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,333
[children laughing]

43
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:46,067
[teacher sounds out letter 'D']
- Children: Oh.

44
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,800
 <i>- Look at how Black students</i>
 <i>are doing.</i>

45
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,667
It is... terrible.

46
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:55,833
[gentle, somber music]

47
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:02,200
- Whatever efforts there have
been by the federal government

48
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,733
to create integrated schools
have not worked.

49
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:12,867
- Education is the conduit
to freedom.

50
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,200
- We have a lot more work
to do.

51
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,400
- Murv Seymour: Wisconsin.

52
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,300
- We're a microcosm
of the nation.

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,833
- We want to create change.

54
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:21,500
- Seymour: A conversation
about race and education

55
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,667
in this state.

56
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,733
- It is a complex one.

57
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:29,500
We've never given full
education access to everyone.

58
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,400
- Seymour:
Author and retired University of
Wisconsin Education Professor,

59
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,833
Dr. Gloria Ladson-Billings,
travels the world

60
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:38,367
learning, teaching, and
training people about education.

61
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:41,367
- It's Thomas Jefferson
who says,

62
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:45,500
"Listen, we are not gonna be
able to maintain a democracy

63
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,233
unless the common folks
are educated."

64
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,633
- It goes all the way
to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

65
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:55,067
- Seymour:
Dr. Christy Clark-Pujara

66
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,933
is a UW-Madison
history professor,

67
00:02:57,067 --> 00:03:00,600
and also works with the
Madison Organization, Nehemiah.

68
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,367
She's an instructor
in its Justified Anger

69
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:04,733
"Black History
for a New Day" course.

70
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,433
Nehemiah focuses
on strengthening

71
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,567
the African American community
in Wisconsin.

72
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,533
The nine-week course
teaches people

73
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:13,333
about race, history,
and justice.

74
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:15,900
She and Ladson-Billings help
explain why the playing field

75
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,367
of education began to take shape

76
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:20,100
out of balance
across the country,

77
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,900
including here in Wisconsin.

78
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:26,367
- Dr. Christy Clark-Pujara:
The laws against
teaching enslaved people to read

79
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:29,067
actually come into play

80
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,967
after the founding
of the nation,

81
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:36,067
in response to
enslaved people

82
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,400
doing things
like forging fake passes.

83
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,367
- Seymour: Written by
their owners,

84
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,933
passes were required for
slaves to leave the plantation

85
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:44,633
for extra work or errands.

86
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:47,567
- When we're talking
about access to education,

87
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:52,633
post-slavery, you just have
cities, states,

88
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,300
and counties

89
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,667
not investing
in the education

90
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:01,133
of Black people,
who are taxpayers.

91
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,633
They would have
inferior school buildings,

92
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:08,500
inferior materials, inferior
books, or notebooks, right?

93
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,233
The teachers
were paid less.

94
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,833
And so, it was
an active disinvestment.

95
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,167
My father was
functionally illiterate.

96
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:18,067
His family was poor,

97
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,400
and he was sharecropping cotton
most of his life,

98
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,767
and his labor was essential
to his family's survival,

99
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:30,133
and the school that
he could attend was underfunded.

100
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:31,767
- Seymour: During the
civil rights era,

101
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,933
Milwaukee was
the epicenter of protests,

102
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:35,100
demanding compliance

103
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,367
to end continued segregation
in schools.

104
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:40,167
- We tend to think about
the Civil Rights Movement,

105
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,733
like the institution of slavery,

106
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:47,300
as something that is uniquely
Southern, and it was not.

107
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,833
- Seymour:
While the US Supreme Court's

108
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,900
 <i>Brown versus</i>
 <i>the Board of Education</i> ruling

109
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:52,233
in the late 1950s

110
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,633
ordered all US schools
to desegregate,

111
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:56,533
Milwaukee and other parts
of the state,

112
00:04:56,633 --> 00:05:00,633
like much of the nation,
didn't do so for decades.

113
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:05,067
- The schools in Milwaukee
are not in line

114
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:09,067
with <i>Brown versus the Board</i>
 <i>of Education</i> until 1979.

115
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:11,933
- Reggie Jackson:
The city of Milwaukee's
public school system decided,

116
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,733
"Well, we're gonna
build new schools,

117
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,833
but we're gonna build them
on the south side,

118
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:18,367
which is primarily
the white part of town, right?"

119
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,933
- The schools that Black people
have access to

120
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:24,067
were severely underfunded.

121
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,933
- Ion Meyn: What you saw
in Black communities

122
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:30,467
was a continual kind of
decline in the tax base,

123
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,200
and the ability to
support public education

124
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,567
in those communities.

125
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,367
- Seymour: A declining
tax base

126
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:38,933
due to declining property
values in housing like this

127
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:40,100
in Milwaukee.

128
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,800
- Housing policy
is education policy.

129
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,167
You go to the schools
in your neighborhood,

130
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:50,833
and we tend to fund schools

131
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,067
through property taxes.

132
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,767
Better than 60%
of Black and brown kids

133
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:58,067
still go
to segregated schools.

134
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:00,067
- Seymour: Schools in
the Milwaukee metro area

135
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,200
are more segregated
for Black and white students

136
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,667
than any other metro area
of the country.

137
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:06,500
That's comparing
Milwaukee schools

138
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,833
to those
in the surrounding counties

139
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:11,333
of Ozaukee, Washington,
and Waukesha.

140
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:13,933
- Whatever efforts there have
been by the federal government

141
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:16,600
to create integrated
schools have not worked.

142
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,067
- There are many white children

143
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,633
who go to all-white districts,

144
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:22,200
and nobody says, "Oh, this is
a segregated district."

145
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,767
They say, "This is
a good district."

146
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:27,767
If you look at performance,

147
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,100
Black and brown kids

148
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
continue to lag.

149
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,067
- Seymour: Those students test
below white students in math,

150
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:34,567
in the early grades,

151
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,233
and it's not just math.

152
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,733
- It speeds
over a hundred miles an hour.

153
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,067
- Seymour: If there's
one indicator

154
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,833
of how students will perform...

155
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:44,667
- Woman: Reading proficiency
is important

156
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,100
across the races.

157
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,900
- Seymour: ...It's their ability
to read by 3rd grade,

158
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:51,367
and state assessments show
that just one year later

159
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:52,767
in the 4th grade,

160
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:56,167
reading scores for Black and
Hispanic students also lag.

161
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:58,300
- The most revolutionary
thing we could do

162
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,300
is teach these kids
how to read.

163
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,500
Whoa!

164
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,800
[leaf blower humming]

165
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,800
- Seymour: But educators
across Wisconsin are working

166
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,533
to reverse these trends.

167
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,667
At One City grade
school in Madison,

168
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:10,833
the focus on reading is key.

169
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:12,800
- Yeah! It kind
of continues on.

170
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,600
- Seymour: 3rd grade teacher,
Kirsty Blattner

171
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,733
teaches reading skills
at this public charter

172
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,500
where more than
80% of the students

173
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,300
are Black, Hispanic,
or multiracial.

174
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,067
Blattner is passionate
about making sure

175
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,800
her students embrace reading.

176
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,867
- Kirsty Blattner: I have a deep
passion for helping scholars

177
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:30,400
that are struggling
academically.

178
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,800
If you have a scholar

179
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,067
that doesn't feel confident
and comfortable with reading,

180
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,433
then they'll find other ways

181
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:38,867
to sort of mask that.

182
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:40,867
Because no one wants to be seen
as not knowing.

183
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:43,767
Instead of, "I can't do this,
 <i>I can't do this yet."</i>

184
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:45,800
Instead of,
"I'm not good at this."

185
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,300
 <i>"What are you good at?</i>

186
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,067
 <i>Would you like</i>
 <i>to be good at this?"</i>

187
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:52,767
- Sara Shaw: America has trouble
talking about race, period.

188
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:54,467
- Seymour: Sara Shaw
researches education

189
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:57,167
for a nonprofit think
tank out of Milwaukee,

190
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:59,500
called the Wisconsin
Policy Forum.

191
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,800
- There's a trope
in literacy circles that

192
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,133
before 3rd grade, students are
learning how to read.

193
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:07,600
And after 3rd grade,

194
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,867
students are
reading to be able to learn.

195
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,200
Think of how many
of your daily activities

196
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,467
become more difficult.

197
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,533
Everything from reading
street signs, to menus,

198
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:18,100
to engaging in the legal system,

199
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,067
or going to the doctor's office.

200
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,300
- Education is the
conduit to freedom.

201
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,833
- Seymour: From grade school
achievement to high school

202
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:27,167
where one superintendent
can boast the benefits

203
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:28,733
of a diverse student body.

204
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,900
- Tremayne Clardy:
We're approximately
35% students of color here

205
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:32,300
in the Verona Area
School District.

206
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,533
We celebrate diversity here

207
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:34,767
in the Verona Area
School District,

208
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:37,767
and we understand
that a diverse clientele

209
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:39,067
in the students
that we serve

210
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,567
allows us to be
a better district.

211
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,233
- Seymour: Inside
the district's signature

212
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:47,433
$150 million high school,
Verona Area
school superintendent

213
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,100
Dr. Tremayne Clardy
is straightforward

214
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,167
about his commitment
and obligation

215
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:53,333
to create equity for
all students in his district,

216
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,833
especially those
that are Black and brown.

217
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:58,067
- It is our responsibility
to move barriers

218
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,133
but never, never
lowering expectations.

219
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:01,967
- Seymour: While recent
statewide data

220
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,733
shows a gap
in the graduation rates

221
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,733
of Black and brown students
compared to white students,

222
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,667
Dr. Clardy and other educators

223
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:09,533
believe the difference in
achievement

224
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,767
has less to do with performance,

225
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:12,767
and more to do
with something else.

226
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:13,933
- It's opportunity.

227
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,233
It's definitely not skill.

228
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,800
It's not intellect.

229
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,200
There's not any other
internal barrier

230
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,067
on behalf of
our Black and brown students.

231
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,500
It is purely about access.

232
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,333
- Seymour: Opportunity and
access are why this school

233
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:29,700
has windows in place of walls,
and wide-open common spaces.

234
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
- We are modeling, you know,
other students seeing

235
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,233
that collaborative process.

236
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,933
We set up our
furniture that way.

237
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:36,533
We set up the classroom
structure that day,

238
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:39,067
because you know the power
of peer-to-peer interaction,

239
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,467
and what that means
to strengthening education.

240
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,400
- Carri: What is that thing
that's in you?

241
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,767
- Seymour: Meet guidance
counselor Carri Hale.

242
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:46,933
- There's no typical day

243
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,633
in the world
of a high school counselor.

244
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:51,767
- Seymour: In the spirit
of strengthening education,

245
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:53,967
in 2018, the district sent her,
and every other teacher

246
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:55,267
to the Nehemiah Justified Anger

247
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:57,300
"Black History
for a New Day" course.

248
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,900
- We really had to get
to the root and heart

249
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,233
of the history of the systems
that have caused

250
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,767
barriers that
we're trying to dismantle.

251
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:05,933
- Seymour: For Carri Hale...

252
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:07,133
- It just fed me.

253
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,933
- Seymour: ...the course
has been life changing.

254
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:11,400
- It's just grown in me
over the years,

255
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,000
and I realized at that time,
there was so much I didn't know.

256
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,833
It benefits me as an educator
so that when I'm working

257
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,433
with a student
who doesn't look like me

258
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,400
or their family
speaks another language,

259
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,667
whatever it might be,

260
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:23,633
that I can
respect them and value them,

261
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,633
and see them, and honor them
for who they are

262
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:26,867
in this space we're in.

263
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:28,267
- Gerald Montgomery:
Well, I definitely struggled

264
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:30,633
trying to figure out who I was,
just like everybody else.

265
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:32,700
- Seymour: Senior Gerald
Montgomery says attending

266
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,100
this diverse high school

267
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
has made him more
culturally aware than ever.

268
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,800
- When I came here, it was
kind of like a cultural shock,

269
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,933
seeing not too many faces
looking like me.

270
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:44,000
- Seymour: It's one of
the reasons Gerald got involved

271
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,833
with the school's Black
student union group...

272
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:48,433
- It's just more of, like,
celebrating Black culture.

273
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:49,933
- Seymour: ...which anyone
can join.

274
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:53,267
- The first BSU year, it was,
like, small, like, 10 people,

275
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:56,467
when I was a freshman,
and now it's like 80.

276
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:59,200
And just seeing like that
group of Black folks around me,

277
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,333
I feel like that really helps
keeping, like, that balance

278
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:04,733
of me going through school
and everyday life.

279
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,733
- Seymour: Gerald says
he plans to go to college.

280
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,400
If he goes to a University
of Wisconsin school,

281
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,933
he'll be one of
a few Black students doing so.

282
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:14,633
Enrollment numbers
show that in 1975,

283
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:17,367
just 2.5% of students
were Black.

284
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:20,100
Nearly 50 years later,
their numbers in 2022

285
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,800
still make up just
2.9% of enrollment law.

286
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,633
While Professor Ion Meyn
believes the numbers

287
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:26,900
should mirror the demographics

288
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:30,500
of the nation's Black population
of about 14%.

289
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,733
- If that gets to 3%,
is that progress?

290
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:37,067
No.

291
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,800
We're not close to progress.

292
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,700
We're not close to even
reckoning with our problem.

293
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,600
- Seymour: The UW System lists
diversity as a core value,

294
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,500
and its five-year plan calls

295
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,567
for boosting African American
enrollment to 15% by 2028.

296
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,500
- Dr. Equan Burrows:
College is a aspiration

297
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,200
that is not afforded to all.

298
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,500
It's our honor to serve

299
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,833
and be one of the only
majority-minority institutions

300
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,633
in the state of Wisconsin.

301
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:07,767
- Seymour: Dr. Equan Burrows
is the dean of students

302
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:09,833
at Milwaukee Area
Technical College,

303
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:12,333
where more than half
the full-time student population

304
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,067
are minorities.

305
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,633
- It's important that we
level that playing field.

306
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,900
Look forward to
being the mentors.

307
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:20,500
- Seymour: Dr. Burrows
runs a mentoring program

308
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,967
with about
a hundred Black male students

309
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:23,767
called
the Men of Color Initiative.

310
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:26,767
- The goals are
to educate and empower students.

311
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,800
- Seymour: The program
hopes to give students

312
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,267
like Jeremiah Crawford a
better chance to finish college

313
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,267
and keep pace
with other students

314
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:34,933
who eventually
gain their bachelor's degree.

315
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:36,167
- Just kind of depends on...

316
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:38,067
- Jeremiah: I've always wanted
to go to college.

317
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,467
My home life was a shambles.

318
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:42,900
It was rough
having a father on drugs.

319
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,300
- Seymour: If that
wasn't enough.

320
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,567
- Jeremiah Crawford: High school
was a point where I started

321
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,900
to retreat into myself.

322
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,200
- Seymour: Jeremiah
has something else

323
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,133
that makes learning and life
more difficult.

324
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:53,933
- Jeremiah: My sickle cell
stood in the way.

325
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,533
- Seymour: He copes
with the blood disorder

326
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:57,067
sickle cell anemia.

327
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,600
- The last thing that you
wanna do is pick up a book,

328
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,467
and my illness
would just take over.

329
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,533
The Men of Color give us
an opportunity to meet,

330
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:07,067
and share our emotions
and our feelings,

331
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,333
and struggles we're having.

332
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:10,133
- Seymour: When it comes to
reading...

333
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,733
- It's a skill that
a lot of people are missing

334
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,167
in this day and age.

335
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:16,100
- Seymour: Jeremiah
knows its importance.

336
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,333
Every day he says he does...

337
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:20,200
- About an hour to two hours
of reading.

338
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,433
I would set an alarm
for 15 minutes.

339
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:25,133
Read, stop reading,
take a break.

340
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:27,767
- Seymour:
He agrees with experts
like Dr. Ladson-Billings

341
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:30,700
who say, reading about
things you like

342
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,200
organically leads
to more reading.

343
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,533
- If you like self-help books,
you should look for that.

344
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:36,733
If you want to learn
how to work on a car,

345
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,133
you should read
those type of books.

346
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:39,933
- I think that's really good;
I liked it.

347
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:41,533
- Seymour: Hitting the books
is often new

348
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:44,300
for a population
that schools can leave behind.

349
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,400
People whose incarceration
cut learning short.

350
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,300
An innovative program
hopes to change that.

351
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,967
- There are many,
many justifications

352
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:53,067
for higher education in prison.

353
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,100
- You opened up a really
important conversation.

354
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,267
- Seymour: This college
classroom is inside a prison.

355
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,233
Odyssey Beyond Bars
conducts this college-level

356
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,833
English composition course
at Racine Correctional

357
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:04,867
and three other prisons
across the state,

358
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:07,367
on behalf
of the University of Wisconsin.

359
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:09,367
- Peter: It transforms
how they look at their lives.

360
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:12,067
Virtually all of our students
have reported to us

361
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,733
at the end of the class

362
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,200
that the
experience in Odyssey

363
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,233
has made them want to
take more college classes.

364
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,833
There are people in prison

365
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:22,067
who look around and think,

366
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:24,300
"I don't ever want
to be back here again,

367
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,733
"and I want to do something
about my life

368
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,433
that ensures that I don't."

369
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:32,067
- I gave the, quote
commencement speech

370
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,267
at Oakwood Correctional Center.

371
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:36,533
- Seymour: Each time,
Dr. Ladson-Billing says,

372
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:38,333
she'd ask one question.

373
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:43,133
- "Raise your hand
if you were ever suspended?"

374
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:48,300
I've never had less than
100% of the hands go up.

375
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:54,067
[gentle poignant music]

376
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,633
- Seymour: Suspensions
and expulsions from high school

377
00:14:57,733 --> 00:14:59,133
can lead to what
has been called,

378
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,067
"the school-to-prison pipeline,"

379
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,200
and at the very least,
disrupt graduation,

380
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,733
and college attainment.

381
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,700
- Now the prisons
are having to go back and say,

382
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,667
"Listen, let's make sure
you get the education

383
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:12,133
you should have gotten."

384
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:15,067
- Seymour: If fixing
the opportunity gap

385
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,067
for Black and brown students
is a puzzle,

386
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,833
another important piece of it

387
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:20,167
is the shortage
of minority teachers.

388
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,200
- They talked about
how my dad would move out,

389
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,467
and how me and my sister...

390
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,367
- Our students want and deserve
to see someone

391
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,233
that looks like them.

392
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,700
- Seymour: For his part,
Superintendent Clardy is proud

393
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,167
of his efforts in his district
to diversify its staff

394
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:36,333
with people like Kabby Hong,
Teacher of the Year.

395
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:38,467
- And then, if you look
at this paragraph.

396
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:42,067
For so many kids of color,

397
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,167
they've never had

398
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:45,533
a teacher of color.

399
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:48,067
A lot of the university programs
are not diverse.

400
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,300
So if your feeder pool
of teacher applicants

401
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,500
is not diverse,

402
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,967
then, of course,
you're not gonna have

403
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:55,933
a diverse
teaching workforce.

404
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:59,100
- Seymour: In 2020, researchers
at the Wisconsin Policy Forum

405
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,900
took an extensive look
into the racial diversity

406
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:04,833
of Wisconsin teachers, and
the student-to-teacher pipeline.

407
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:06,567
The takeaway...
- I want you to...

408
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:09,100
- Sara: [exhaling]
We have a lot more work to do.

409
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,633
- Seymour: Shaw says, ideally...

410
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:13,267
- That the diversity of the
student body would be reflected

411
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:15,967
in the diversity of
the teacher population.

412
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,533
- Seymour: While almost one
third of students in Wisconsin

413
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:21,800
are students of color, only
about 6% of their teachers are,

414
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,067
and many don't stay.

415
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:26,400
- Teachers of color who come
into the workforce are leaving

416
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,733
at a faster rate
than our white teachers.

417
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,067
- Okay?

418
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,233
- Seymour: Many educators
say a diverse teaching staff

419
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,233
positively impacts all students
in a lot of different ways.

420
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,933
- We see positive impacts
across everything

421
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:39,633
from student motivation

422
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:43,233
to strong student-teacher
relationships,

423
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:47,567
to absenteeism, graduation rates
and going on to college.

424
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:50,667
- When you look
at the educational inequities,

425
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:53,067
I think it is
just intrinsically tied

426
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:55,267
to the inequities
that are in society,

427
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:57,133
but it's gonna take
policy changes--

428
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:58,300
not just talk.

429
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,833
- For his part,
Verona Superintendent Clardy

430
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:03,600
is moving beyond talking
and taking action.

431
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,267
- I'm not a worrier;
I'm a doer.

432
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:07,300
And so we're about
doing the work.

433
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:10,067
- We continue our reporting

434
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,433
on race and education

435
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:13,567
in the state of Wisconsin
here from the campus

436
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,233
of the University of Wisconsin
in Madison.

437
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,567
Here to continue
the conversation,

438
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,167
we're joined by Dr. Alex Gee

439
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:21,133
from the Nehemiah Center
for Urban Leadership
and Development.

440
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:23,933
Mr. Kaleem Caire, Superintendent
of One City Schools

441
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:25,300
here in Madison,

442
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,700
and Dr. Courtney Bell,
who is the director

443
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,967
of the Wisconsin Center
for Educational Research.

444
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:33,067
As I've traveled and talked
to folks across the state

445
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:34,733
about this issue,

446
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,733
I get the sense
that it's a very touchy subject.

447
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,167
Is there something to that?

448
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,633
- Race is a touchy subject
in the United States.

449
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:44,567
I think, when we think
about systemic racism,

450
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,933
which exists in education,

451
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,400
we think about these sort
of interlocking layers

452
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,767
of systems and policies, right?

453
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:52,567
So, you only need
to think about

454
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,400
how do we draw
the district boundary,

455
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,367
and the way that interacts
with the neighborhoods,

456
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:59,600
the neighborhood
attendance zone,

457
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,533
the teachers
the school can attract,

458
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:05,067
the outcomes that then wind up
in that neighborhood,

459
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,500
that those
are interlocking systems.

460
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,467
So, it is contentious, I think
partly because people do care,

461
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,267
but the persistent inequalities
are hard to look at

462
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:14,767
in this state,
in particular.

463
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,967
- Dr. Gee, why are people
afraid to talk about this?

464
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:18,633
- Because I think
it's difficult

465
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:20,100
to face up to the culpability.

466
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,767
We like to quote statistics,
but we don't really want

467
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:25,800
to look at our ownership
in the problem

468
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,800
or why we've allowed
it to persist.

469
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,867
In educational services systems,

470
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,067
we want to fight
against racism,

471
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,167
but when we don't
properly address it,

472
00:18:36,267 --> 00:18:38,067
the educational systems
themselves

473
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,700
become breeding grounds
for racism.

474
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,500
And I think we just like
to pass the buck

475
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,333
to someone else without
taking full responsibility.

476
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:48,100
- I think they're both
absolutely spot on,

477
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,900
but I also think that
we have divorced ourselves

478
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:53,333
from the problem.

479
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,633
That it is not only something
that I'm embarrassed

480
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:58,433
or don't want to be culpable in,

481
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:03,600
but it's been persistent
for so long,

482
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,133
and if I know about it,
I'm tired of hearing of it,

483
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,167
and so, it brings me down.

484
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:10,767
I've heard people say that,
like,

485
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:14,067
"I can't focus on the problem
'cause it just brings me down.

486
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,400
"'Cause it's like
we've not solved it,

487
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,800
it's not gonna be solved."

488
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,833
And so, I think
there's a lot of hopelessness.

489
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:22,567
I also think that we also
live in a state that,

490
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,067
by and large, has been
privileged for a very long time,

491
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,167
particularly in the area
where we are in Madison.

492
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:30,267
And so, when you're privileged,
and things are going okay,

493
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,867
and you don't have to
focus on the issue,

494
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:35,200
you act like it doesn't exist.

495
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,067
- But this lack of success
that we're seeing,

496
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,733
is it more to blame
on the teachers,

497
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,233
or is it more to blame
on students?

498
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,900
- I think there's enough blame
to go around, actually.

499
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:49,167
But I think, if we ignore
the systemic issues,

500
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:53,867
and only point fingers to the
parents, the students, teachers,

501
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:55,367
not look
at the larger issue,

502
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:58,700
I think we continue just
to kick the can down the road.

503
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,633
And so, I think we have to
look at really how we got here.

504
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,467
I think what makes it
even more difficult is

505
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:08,133
that education has been deemed
the great equalizer.

506
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:10,700
Education is what brings you
into the mainstream,

507
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,467
and it keeps you from being
discriminated against.

508
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:14,000
It keeps you from being poor.

509
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,167
And when that system
that's meant to elevate us

510
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:17,700
is keeping
certain people down

511
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,900
it's the antithesis
to what we think

512
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,367
of when we think
about education.

513
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:22,767
And then,
we have to really begin

514
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:24,533
to ask ourselves
real tough questions.

515
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:26,367
But we're trying
to educate children

516
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:28,433
in a system, in a world,
in a reality

517
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:31,433
where there's
so much brokenness and pain,

518
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,067
and disregard
for who they are,

519
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,900
their pain, and their culture.

520
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,900
So, I think we really need
an overhaul

521
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,067
in how we even look at
what education means for us.

522
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,867
- And we know a lot of times
we find solutions looking

523
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:43,600
at other communities,
other school districts,

524
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,167
things like that.

525
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:49,967
Dr. Bell, we know you work
across the world, the country,

526
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,533
looking at different ways
people do research

527
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,200
to solve these kinds of issues.

528
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,533
Is there any district
out there anywhere

529
00:20:55,633 --> 00:21:00,067
that's doing things well in
terms of addressing these issues

530
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,233
with Black and brown
students falling behind?

531
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,367
- You know there
are success cases.

532
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:08,600
My colleague
Gudiel R. Crosthwaite
is the superintendent

533
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,367
in Lynwood Unified,
which is in LA.

534
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:14,533
They have
community-based schools.

535
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:18,567
They have colleagues of color,
professionals of color

536
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,400
in those school buildings.

537
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,067
Not <i>only</i> colleagues of color,
but some.

538
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:25,833
They are committed.

539
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:27,900
They believe
that all those kids can learn.

540
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:30,267
They have tons of AP courses
in those high schools.

541
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:33,067
They are starting
with early Pre-K.

542
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,300
And so, they hold them tight,

543
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,067
and they treat them
with dignity,

544
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:39,567
and those families with
dignity the whole way up.

545
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,367
- Now Kaleem, you've built
a pretty unique environment

546
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,567
in One City.

547
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,500
What are some of the things
that you're doing

548
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,400
that you feel like
other districts can learn from?

549
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,900
- Well, there's
quite a few things.

550
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:50,433
First and foremost, it's
the number of our young people

551
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:53,967
that are coming to us who
are so far behind academically.

552
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,833
Doesn't matter
the grade level that they're at,

553
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:57,200
but it's even more depressing

554
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,367
when they come to you in 9th
and 10th grade and who have a...

555
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:03,100
We have a third of our kids
are at the--

556
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,067
somewhere between 1st and 4th
grade level in math and reading.

557
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:08,933
It's like you just pass them
along to 9th and 10th grade

558
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:12,233
without intervening to address
their real core challenges.

559
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,100
First six to eight weeks,
we get to know our kids.

560
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,300
Then we pivot
'cause we see where they're at.

561
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,967
We test 'em, we look
at what they're,

562
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:20,600
how they interact in school,

563
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,700
how they show up
as students every day.

564
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,633
And two hours in the morning
students are in math.

565
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:28,100
Two hours in the afternoon,
they're in language arts,

566
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,733
and it's not just
instruction all day.

567
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,067
The first part of that
is instruction at their level.

568
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:34,267
And then we bring in tutors
that we've trained.

569
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:36,400
We've trained
over 50 tutors to come in,

570
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,167
and work with them one-on-one,
no more than one-on-two

571
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:41,367
to help them
to get up to grade levels.

572
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:45,133
So we have a personalized
learning environment for them

573
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:46,633
so we can move them forward.

574
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,933
So we won't be passing
kids in our school forward

575
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,233
to 9th and 10th grade
who aren't ready to be there.

576
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,533
- Dr. Gee, you've got one
superpower I'm gonna give you

577
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:55,933
to fix this problem.

578
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:57,400
What are you gonna do with it?

579
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,700
- We've got to really embed
the importance

580
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,267
of helping students to...

581
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:03,133
and I'll speak specifically
to our work

582
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:06,133
with African American children

583
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:09,133
with really understanding
and appreciating the culture.

584
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:11,933
You know, if we were to
go back in time 60 years ago,

585
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:13,667
we would not be having
this conversation.

586
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,467
Black people were going to

587
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:17,867
historically Black
colleges and universities.

588
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:20,200
Building historically Black
colleges and universities,

589
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,600
building churches
and businesses,

590
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,933
highly successful educationally
with integration.

591
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:27,333
And one of my mentors,

592
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:28,933
and she probably
has mentored all of us,

593
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:30,333
Dr. Gloria
Ladson-Billings has always said,

594
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:32,300
"But, Alex, remember,
with integration,

595
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,067
30,000 Black teachers
lost their jobs

596
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:38,067
'cause they did not,
they were not integrated."

597
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,300
- Seymour: That's right.

598
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,700
- Black students were,
Black teachers weren't,

599
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,500
and many of them
became domestics.

600
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,267
And so, we have to understand
that this is somewhat new.

601
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:47,967
Because again, 60 years ago,
we weren't saying,

602
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:49,433
"How do we educate
our Black children?"

603
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:51,067
We were probably asking,
"How do we vote?"

604
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:52,533
But Black children
were becoming

605
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:55,067
dentists and doctors
and nurses and professors,

606
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,633
and then something happened.

607
00:23:56,733 --> 00:24:00,067
So my superpower would be,
let's get them in places

608
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:02,367
where teachers can relate
to them, understand them,

609
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:07,067
celebrate them, and where they
see themselves in textbooks.

610
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:08,633
I came to Madison advanced
in 2nd grade,

611
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:11,067
but I had a Black teacher
in 1st grade who told me

612
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,067
I was gonna be the president
of the United States.

613
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,333
She's 102 years old,
and we're still pen pals.

614
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:17,400
We're talking is if
we have to fix Black children.

615
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,067
What we have to
really ask ourselves is,

616
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,600
"How are we
breaking Black children?"

617
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,567
- So, we know most parts
of Wisconsin

618
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:26,500
have a very tiny population
of students of color,

619
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,967
if any at all.

620
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,567
So when you talk about the folks
that sit at home right now,

621
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,367
and say, "This has
nothing to do with me."

622
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:36,233
How do we get those
folks to have a stake

623
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,300
in this game to
make things better?

624
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,700
- I'd like to go back to
something that was said earlier

625
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,667
about the function
of education in,

626
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:44,467
and I'll say, a democracy.

627
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:48,233
This affects all of us,
every single one of us,

628
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:49,833
no matter what
our racial background is,

629
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:51,367
no matter where we live.

630
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:53,067
If we do not have democracy,

631
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:54,867
that functions with civility,

632
00:24:54,967 --> 00:24:58,433
where people can consider
issues of science

633
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:02,833
in the public domain of policy
around all manner of things:

634
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,300
housing, power, you name it,

635
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,933
all the things,
social services, farm subsidies,

636
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:08,333
whatever it may be.

637
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:10,067
We need an educated citizenry.

638
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:11,800
That's what the country
was founded on.

639
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,233
So for me,
this is about all of us.

640
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:17,367
These are all of our children;
this is our country.

641
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:19,200
- And I would say
America's at risk.

642
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,633
If you produce children
who lack an interest,

643
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:26,267
and passion to solve the big
problems of today and tomorrow,

644
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:28,733
who's gonna be there
to solve them?

645
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:32,167
We have to focus on education
and make it, I believe,

646
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:33,900
our number one priority
in this country.

647
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:36,200
And if we want a country
that's not divided,

648
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,867
we also have to have
a education that unifies people

649
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:41,467
rather than divides them.

650
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:44,200
And so if we do those things,
we'll succeed.

651
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,067
If not, you know, our demise
is we already have signs

652
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:49,533
of what
it will look like.

653
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,333
- If we don't learn
how to work together,

654
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:53,067
and work for and with,
be educated by,

655
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:55,867
and educating people
who don't look like us,

656
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:57,533
we can't fool
ourselves in thinking

657
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:58,933
that we're ready
for a global market,

658
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:01,233
that we want to compete
in the global market.

659
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,100
And so,
we can't boast of having

660
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,533
world-class
school districts or universities

661
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:08,500
if we don't know
how to talk to people

662
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,067
who are from our own state
who look different.

663
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,833
And so, I think we have to own
the broader problem.

664
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:16,667
Otherwise, we can't boast
in producing people

665
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:19,467
who can compete internationally
for jobs,

666
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:21,133
or awards, or opportunities.

667
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:23,467
- Seymour: We'll have
to leave it there, Dr. Gee.

668
00:26:23,567 --> 00:26:24,533
Thank you, sir.
- My pleasure.

669
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:25,867
- Kaleem Caire, thank you.
- Thank you.

670
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:27,867
- Dr. Courtney Bell,
we appreciate you.

671
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:30,467
And we thank you folks at home
for joining us as well.
