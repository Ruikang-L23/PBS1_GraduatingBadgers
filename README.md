**Backend:**
1. Navigate to the transcript-back-end folder.
2. Install necessary dependencies using pip
    You probably have to do these commands:
    "pip install flask"
    "pip install flask_cors"
    "pip install openai==0.28"
3. Create a system environment variable on your machine with the variable name being "OpenAI" and the variable value being the API key. You probably have to restart your PC afterwards.
4. Start the API on your machine by typing `python api.py` into your terminal.

**Frontend:**
1. Navigate to the transcript-front-end folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies for the frontend.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start up the frontend on your machine.
